\v 41 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah,

\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he \add was
\add* the firstborn; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father’s bed, his
birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the
genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright. 
\v 2 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him \add came\add* the
chief ruler; but the birthright \add was\add* Joseph’s:) 
\v 3 The sons, \add I say,\add* of Reuben the firstborn of Israel \add were,

\v 4 The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,

\add captive:\add* he \add was\add* prince of the Reubenites. 
\v 7 And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their
generations was reckoned, \add were\add* the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah, 
\v 8 And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in
Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baal-meon: 
\v 9 And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the
river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the \add land
\add* of Gilead. 
\v 10 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by
their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout all the east land of
Gilead.
\p
\v 11 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land of Bashan
unto Salchah: 
\v 12 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in
Bashan. 
\v 13 And their brethren of the house of their fathers \add were,\add*

\v 16 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the

\v 17 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of
Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.
\p
\v 18 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of
valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and
skilful in war, \add were\add* four and forty thousand seven hundred and
threescore, that went out to the war. 
\v 19 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and
Nodab. 
\v 20 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into
their hand, and all that \add were\add* with them: for they cried to God in
the battle, and he was intreated of them; because they put their trust in
him. 
\v 21 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of
sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an
hundred thousand. 
\v 22 For there fell down many slain, because the war \add was\add* of God.
And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.
\p
\v 23 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land: they
increased from Bashan unto Baal-hermon and Senir, and unto mount Hermon. 
\v 24 And these \add were\add* the heads of the house of their fathers, even
Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and
Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, \add and\add* heads of the house of
their fathers.
\p
\v 25 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a
whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before
them. 
\v 26 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and
the spirit of Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even
the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought
them unto Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.

\v 2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the
Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul. 
\v 3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he
was wounded of the archers. 
\v 4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through
therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer
would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it. 
\v 5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the
sword, and died. 
\v 6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together. 
\v 7 And when all the men of Israel that \add were\add* in the valley saw that
they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their
cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the
slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa. 
\v 9 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and
sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their
idols, and to the people. 
\v 10 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his
head in the temple of Dagon.
\p
\v 11 And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to
Saul, 
\v 12 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the
bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under
the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
\p
\v 13 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD,
\add even\add* against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for
asking \add counsel\add* of \add one that had\add* a familiar spirit, to
enquire \add of it; \add*
\v 14 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the
kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold,
we \add are\add* thy bone and thy flesh. 
\v 2 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou \add wast
\add* he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy God said
unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my
people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel. 
\v 3 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David
made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David
king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.
\p
\v 4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which \add is\add* Jebus;
where the Jebusites \add were,\add* the inhabitants of the land. 
\v 5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither.
Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which \add is\add* the city of
David. 
\v 6 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and
captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief. 
\v 7 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of
David. 
\v 8 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab
repaired the rest of the city. 
\v 9 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts \add was
\add* with him.
\p
\v 10 These also \add are\add* the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who
strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, \add and\add* with all
Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning
Israel. 
\v 11 And this \add is\add* the number of the mighty men whom David had;
Jashobeam, and Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear
against three hundred slain \add by him\add* at one time. 
\v 12 And after him \add was\add* Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who 
\add was one\add* of the three mighties. 
\v 13 He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered
together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the
people fled from before the Philistines. 
\v 14 And they set themselves in the midst of \add that\add* parcel, and
delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved \add them
\add* by a great deliverance.
\p
\v 15 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into
the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of
Rephaim. 
\v 16 And David \add was\add* then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison
\add was\add* then at Bethlehem. 
\v 17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water
of the well of Bethlehem, that \add is\add* at the gate! 
\v 18 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water
out of the well of Bethlehem, that \add was\add* by the gate, and took 
\add it,\add* and brought \add it\add* to David: but David would not drink 
\add of\add* it, but poured it out to the LORD, 
\v 19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I
drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with 
\add the jeopardy of\add* their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not
drink it. These things did these three mightiest.
\p
\v 20 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting
up his spear against three hundred, he slew \add them,\add* and had a name
among the three. 
\v 21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their
captain: howbeit he attained not to the \add first\add* three. 
\v 22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who
had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and
slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day. 
\v 23 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of \add great\add* stature, five cubits
high; and in the Egyptian’s hand \add was\add* a spear like a weaver’s beam;
and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the
Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear. 
\v 24 These \add things\add* did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
among the three mighties. 
\v 25 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the 
\add first\add* three: and David set him over his guard.
\p
\v 26 Also the valiant men of the armies \add were,\add* Asahel the brother of
Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 
\v 27 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite, 
\v 28 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abi-ezer the Antothite, 
\v 29 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite, 
\v 30 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the Netophathite, 
\v 31 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, \add that pertained\add* to the
children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite, 
\v 32 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite, 
\v 33 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite, 
\v 34 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the
Hararite, 
\v 35 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur, 
\v 36 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite, 
\v 37 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai, 
\v 38 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri, 
\v 39 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of Joab the
son of Zeruiah, 
\v 40 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 
\v 41 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai, 
\v 42 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the Reubenites, and
thirty with him, 
\v 43 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite, 
\v 44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan the
Aroerite, 
\v 45 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite, 
\v 46 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and
Ithmah the Moabite, 
\v 47 Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet
kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they \add were
\add* among the mighty men, helpers of the war. 
\v 2 \add They were\add* armed with bows, and could use both the right hand
and the left in \add hurling\add* stones and \add shooting\add* arrows out of
a bow, \add even\add* of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin. 
\v 3 The chief \add was\add* Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and
Jehu the Antothite, 
\v 4 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the
thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite,
\v 5 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the
Haruphite, 
\v 6 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the
Korhites, 
\v 7 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 
\v 8 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to
the wilderness men of might, \add and\add* men of war \add fit\add* for the
battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces \add were like
\add* the faces of lions, and \add were\add* as swift as the roes upon the
mountains; 
\v 9 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
\v 10 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth, 
\v 11 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
\v 12 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
\v 13 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh. 
\v 14 These \add were\add* of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of
the least \add was\add* over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand. 
\v 15 These \add are\add* they that went over Jordan in the first month, when
it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all \add them
\add* of the valleys, \add both\add* toward the east, and toward the west. 
\v 16 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the hold unto
David. 
\v 17 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye
be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but
if \add ye be come\add* to betray me to mine enemies, seeing \add there is
\add* no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look \add thereon,
\add* and rebuke \add it. \add*
\v 18 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, \add who was\add* chief of the
captains, \add and he said,\add* Thine \add are we,\add* David, and on thy
side, thou son of Jesse: peace, peace \add be\add* unto thee, and peace 
\add be\add* to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received
them, and made them captains of the band. 
\v 19 And there fell \add some\add* of Manasseh to David, when he came with
the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the
lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall
to his master Saul to \add the jeopardy of\add* our heads. 
\v 20 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad,
and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the
thousands that \add were\add* of Manasseh. 
\v 21 And they helped David against the band \add of the rovers:\add* for they
\add were\add* all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host. 
\v 22 For at \add that\add* time day by day there came to David to help him,
until \add it was\add* a great host, like the host of God.
\p
\v 23 And these \add are\add* the numbers of the bands \add that were
\add* ready armed to the war, \add and\add* came to David to Hebron, to turn
the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD. 
\v 24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear \add were\add* six
thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war. 
\v 25 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven
thousand and one hundred. 
\v 26 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred. 
\v 27 And Jehoiada \add was\add* the leader of the Aaronites, and with him 
\add were\add* three thousand and seven hundred; 
\v 28 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house
twenty and two captains. 
\v 29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand:
for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of
Saul. 
\v 30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty
men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers. 
\v 31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were
expressed by name, to come and make David king. 
\v 32 And of the children of Issachar, \add which were men\add* that had
understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them
\add were\add* two hundred; and all their brethren \add were\add* at their
commandment. 
\v 33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all
instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: \add they were
\add* not of double heart. 
\v 34 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear
thirty and seven thousand. 
\v 35 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six
hundred. 
\v 36 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty
thousand. 
\v 37 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and
of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the
battle, an hundred and twenty thousand. 
\v 38 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to
Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel 
\add were\add* of one heart to make David king. 
\v 39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for
their brethren had prepared for them. 
\v 40 Moreover they that were nigh them, \add even\add* unto Issachar and
Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and
on oxen, \add and\add* meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and
wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for \add there was\add* joy in
Israel.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, 
\add and\add* with every leader. 
\v 2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If \add it seem
\add* good unto you, and \add that it be\add* of the LORD our God, let us send
abroad unto our brethren every where, \add that are\add* left in all the land
of Israel, and with them \add also\add* to the priests and Levites \add which
are\add* in their cities \add and\add* suburbs, that they may gather
themselves unto us: 
\v 3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we enquired not at
it in the days of Saul. 
\v 4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was
right in the eyes of all the people. 
\v 5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the
entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim. 
\v 6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, \add that is,\add* to
Kirjath- jearim, which \add belonged\add* to Judah, to bring up thence the ark
of God the LORD, that dwelleth \add between\add* the cherubims, whose name is
called \add on it. \add*
\v 7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of
Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart. 
\v 8 And David and all Israel played before God with all \add their
\add* might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with
timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
\p
\v 9 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his
hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled. 
\v 10 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him,
because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God. 
\v 11 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach upon Uzza:
wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day. 
\v 12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark
of God \add home\add* to me? 
\v 13 So David brought not the ark \add home\add* to himself to the city of
David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
\v 14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house
three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he
had.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars,
with masons and carpenters, to build him an house. 
\v 2 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for
his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.
\p
\v 3 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and
daughters. 
\v 4 Now these \add are\add* the names of \add his\add* children which he had
in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon, 
\v 5 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet, 
\v 6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 
\v 7 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
\p
\v 8 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all
Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard \add of
it,\add* and went out against them. 
\v 9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 10 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto
him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand. 
\v 11 So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David
said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking
forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim. 
\v 12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and
they were burned with fire. 
\v 13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley. 
\v 14 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up
after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry
trees. 
\v 15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of
the mulberry trees, \add that\add* then thou shalt go out to battle: for God
is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. 
\v 16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the
Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer. 
\v 17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the
fear of him upon all nations.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 And \add David\add* made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a
place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent. 
\v 2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for
them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him
for ever. 
\v 3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark
of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it. 
\v 4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites: 
\v 5 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and
twenty: 
\v 6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and
twenty: 
\v 7 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and
thirty: 
\v 8 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two
hundred: 
\v 9 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore: 
\v 10 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred
and twelve. 
\v 11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the
Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 
\v 12 And said unto them, Ye \add are\add* the chief of the fathers of the
Levites: sanctify yourselves, \add both\add* ye and your brethren, that ye may
bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto \add the place that
\add* I have prepared for it. 
\v 13 For because ye \add did it\add* not at the first, the LORD our God made
a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. 
\v 14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark
of the LORD God of Israel. 
\v 15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders
with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the
LORD. 
\v 16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren 
\add to be\add* the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps
and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy. 
\v 17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren,
Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan
the son of Kushaiah; 
\v 18 And with them their brethren of the second \add degree,\add* Zechariah,
Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah,
and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and
Jeiel, the porters. 
\v 19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, \add were appointed\add* to
sound with cymbals of brass; 
\v 20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and
Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth; 
\v 21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel,
and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel. 
\v 22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, \add was\add* for song: he
instructed about the song, because he \add was\add* skilful. 
\v 23 And Berechiah and Elkanah \add were\add* doorkeepers for the ark. 
\v 24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets
before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah \add were\add* doorkeepers for
the ark.
\p
\v 25 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands,
went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of
Obed-edom with joy. 
\v 26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of
the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams. 
\v 27 And David \add was\add* clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the
song with the singers: David also \add had\add* upon him an ephod of linen. 
\v 28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with
shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals,
making a noise with psalteries and harps.
\p
\v 29 And it came to pass, \add as\add* the ark of the covenant of the LORD
came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a
window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that
David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace
offerings before God. 
\v 2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the
peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD. 
\v 3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a
loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon \add of wine.
\add*
\p
\v 4 And he appointed \add certain\add* of the Levites to minister before the
ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of
Israel: 
\v 5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and
Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with
psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals; 
\v 6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before
the ark of the covenant of God.
\p
\v 7 Then on that day David delivered first \add this psalm\add* to thank the
LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren. 
\v 8 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among
the people. 
\v 9 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works. 
\v 10 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the
LORD. 
\v 11 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually. 
\v 12 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the
judgments of his mouth; 
\v 13 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
\v 14 He \add is\add* the LORD our God; his judgments \add are\add* in all the
earth. 
\v 15 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word \add which\add* he
commanded to a thousand generations; 
\v 16 \add Even of the covenant\add* which he made with Abraham, and of his
oath unto Isaac; 
\v 17 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, \add and\add* to Israel
\add for\add* an everlasting covenant, 
\v 18 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your
inheritance; 
\v 19 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it. 
\v 20 And \add when\add* they went from nation to nation, and from \add one
\add* kingdom to another people; 
\v 21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their
sakes, 
\v 22 \add Saying,\add* Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm. 
\v 23 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his
salvation. 
\v 24 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all
nations. 
\v 25 For great \add is\add* the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also 
\add is\add* to be feared above all gods. 
\v 26 For all the gods of the people \add are\add* idols: but the LORD made
the heavens. 
\v 27 Glory and honour \add are\add* in his presence; strength and gladness 
\add are\add* in his place. 
\v 28 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory
and strength. 
\v 29 Give unto the LORD the glory \add due\add* unto his name: bring an
offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 
\v 30 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it
be not moved. 
\v 31 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let \add men
\add* say among the nations, The LORD reigneth. 
\v 32 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and
all that \add is\add* therein. 
\v 33 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD,
because he cometh to judge the earth. 
\v 34 O give thanks unto the LORD; for \add he is\add* good; for his mercy 
\add endureth\add* for ever. 
\v 35 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and
deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, 
\add and\add* glory in thy praise. 
\v 36 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all
the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.
\p
\v 37 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and
his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work
required: 
\v 38 And Obed- edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also
the son of Jeduthun and Hosah \add to be\add* porters: 
\v 39 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the
tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that \add was\add* at Gibeon, 
\v 40 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt
offering continually morning and evening, and \add to do\add* according to all
that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel; 
\v 41 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who
were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy 
\add endureth\add* for ever; 
\v 42 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those
that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of
Jeduthun \add were\add* porters. 
\v 43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned
to bless his house.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan
the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of
the LORD \add remaineth\add* under curtains. 
\v 2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for God 
\add is\add* with thee.
\p
\v 3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan,
saying, 
\v 4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not build
me an house to dwell in: 
\v 5 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel
unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from \add one\add*
tabernacle \add to another. \add*
\v 6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the
judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not
built me an house of cedars? 
\v 7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the
LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, \add even\add* from following
the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel: 
\v 8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut
off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the
name of the great men that \add are\add* in the earth. 
\v 9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and
they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the
children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning, 
\v 10 And since the time that I commanded judges \add to be\add* over my
people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell
thee that the LORD will build thee an house.
\p
\v 11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go 
\add to be\add* with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee,
which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. 
\v 12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. 
\v 13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my
mercy away from him, as I took \add it\add* from \add him\add* that was before
thee: 
\v 14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his
throne shall be established for evermore. 
\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did
Nathan speak unto David.
\p
\v 16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who 
\add am\add* I, O LORD God, and what \add is\add* mine house, that thou hast
brought me hitherto? 
\v 17 And \add yet\add* this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou
hast \add also\add* spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come,
and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD
God. 
\v 18 What can David \add speak\add* more to thee for the honour of thy
servant? for thou knowest thy servant. 
\v 19 O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast
thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. 
\v 20 O LORD, \add there is\add* none like thee, neither \add is there any
\add* God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 
\v 21 And what one nation in the earth \add is\add* like thy people Israel,
whom God went to redeem \add to be\add* his own people, to make thee a name of
greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people,
whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? 
\v 22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and
thou, LORD, becamest their God. 
\v 23 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy
servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast
said. 
\v 24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever,
saying, The LORD of hosts \add is\add* the God of Israel, \add even
\add* a God to Israel: and \add let\add* the house of David thy servant 
\add be\add* established before thee. 
\v 25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an
house: therefore thy servant hath found \add in his heart\add* to pray before
thee. 
\v 26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy
servant: 
\v 27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that
it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and \add it shall
be\add* blessed for ever.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and
subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David’s servants, \add and
\add* brought gifts.
\p
\v 3 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to
stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates. 
\v 4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen,
and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot \add horses,
\add* but reserved of them an hundred chariots. 
\v 5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah,
David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. 
\v 6 Then David put \add garrisons\add* in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians
became David’s servants, \add and\add* brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved
David whithersoever he went. 
\v 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 
\v 8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David
very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and
the vessels of brass.
\p
\v 9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of
Hadarezer king of Zobah; 
\v 10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to
congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him;
(for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and \add with him\add* all manner of vessels
of gold and silver and brass.
\p
\v 11 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the
gold that he brought from all \add these\add* nations; from Edom, and from
Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from
Amalek. 
\v 12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley
of salt eighteen thousand.
\p
\v 13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David’s
servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
\p
\v 14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice
among all his people. 
\v 15 And Joab the son Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of
Ahilud, recorder. 
\v 16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, 
\add were\add* the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; 
\v 17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada \add was\add* over the Cherethites and
the Pelethites; and the sons of David \add were\add* chief about the king.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of
Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash,
because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort
him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the
children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him. 
\v 3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou
that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are
not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy
out the land? 
\v 4 Wherefore Hanun took David’s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their
garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away. 
\v 5 Then there went \add certain,\add* and told David how the men were
served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the
king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and \add then
\add* return.
\p
\v 6 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious
to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to
hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah,
and out of Zobah. 
\v 7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah
and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon
gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle. 
\v 8 And when David heard \add of it,\add* he sent Joab, and all the host of
the mighty men. 
\v 9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before
the gate of the city: and the kings that were come \add were\add* by
themselves in the field. 
\v 10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind,
he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put \add them\add* in array
against the Syrians. 
\v 11 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his
brother, and they set \add themselves\add* in array against the children of
Ammon. 
\v 12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help
me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help
thee. 
\v 13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our
people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do \add that which is
\add* good in his sight. 
\v 14 So Joab and the people that \add were\add* with him drew nigh before the
Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him. 
\v 15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they
likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab
came to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 16 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel,
they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that \add were\add* beyond
the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer \add went
\add* before them. 
\v 17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over
Jordan, and came upon them, and set \add the battle\add* in array against
them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they
fought with him. 
\v 18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven
thousand \add men which fought in\add* chariots, and forty thousand footmen,
and killed Shophach the captain of the host. 
\v 19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse
before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither
would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that
kings go out \add to battle,\add* Joab led forth the power of the army, and
wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But
David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it. 
\v 2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to
weigh a talent of gold, and \add there were\add* precious stones in it; and it
was set upon David’s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the
city. 
\v 3 And he brought out the people that \add were\add* in it, and cut 
\add them\add* with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so
dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all
the people returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 4 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the
Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, \add that
was\add* of the children of the giant: and they were subdued. 
\v 5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair
slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff \add was
\add* like a weaver’s beam. 
\v 6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of \add great
\add* stature, whose fingers and toes \add were\add* four and twenty, six 
\add on each hand,\add* and six \add on each foot:\add* and he also was the
son of the giant. 
\v 7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David’s brother
slew him. 
\v 8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of
David, and by the hand of his servants.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel. 
\v 2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel
from Beer- sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may
know \add it. \add*
\v 3 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more
as they \add be:\add* but, my lord the king, \add are\add* they not all my
lord’s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a
cause of trespass to Israel? 
\v 4 Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab
departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all 
\add they of\add* Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men
that drew sword: and Judah \add was\add* four hundred threescore and ten
thousand men that drew sword. 
\v 6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s word was
abominable to Joab. 
\v 7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel. 
\v 8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this
thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I
have done very foolishly.
\p
\v 9 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying, 
\v 10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three 
\add things:\add* choose thee one of them, that I may do \add it\add* unto
thee. 
\v 11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Choose
thee 
\v 12 Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy
foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh \add thee;\add* or else
three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the land, and the
angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now
therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me. 
\v 13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into
the hand of the LORD; for very great \add are\add* his mercies: but let me not
fall into the hand of man.
\p
\v 14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel
seventy thousand men. 
\v 15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was
destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the
angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the
LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite. 
\v 16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD stand
between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched
out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders \add of Israel, who were
\add* clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces. 
\v 17 And David said unto God, \add Is it\add* not I \add that\add* commanded
the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed;
but \add as for\add* these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray
thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on thy
people, that they should be plagued.
\p
\v 18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that David
should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Ornan
the Jebusite. 
\v 19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of
the LORD. 
\v 20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid
themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat. 
\v 21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of
the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with \add his\add* face to the
ground. 
\v 22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of \add this\add*
threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou shalt
grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the
people. 
\v 23 And Ornan said unto David, Take \add it\add* to thee, and let my lord
the king do \add that which is\add* good in his eyes: lo,I give \add thee
\add* the oxen \add also\add* for burnt offerings, and the threshing
instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all. 
\v 24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full
price: for I will not take \add that\add* which \add is\add* thine for the
LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost. 
\v 25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by
weight. 
\v 26 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered him
from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering. 
\v 27 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the
sheath thereof.
\p
\v 28 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in the
threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there. 
\v 29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the wilderness, and
the altar of the burnt offering, \add were\add* at that season in the high
place at Gibeon. 
\v 30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was afraid
because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then David said, This \add is\add* the house of the LORD God, and this 
\add is\add* the altar of the burnt offering for Israel. 
\v 2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that \add were
\add* in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build
the house of God. 
\v 3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the
gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight; 
\v 4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought
much cedar wood to David. 
\v 5 And David said, Solomon my son \add is\add* young and tender, and the
house \add that is\add* to be builded for the LORD \add must be\add* exceeding
magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will \add therefore
\add* now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his
death.
\p
\v 6 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for
the LORD God of Israel. 
\v 7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build
an house unto the name of the LORD my God: 
\v 8 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood
abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my
name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight. 
\v 9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I
will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be
Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days. 
\v 10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I 
\add will be\add* his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom
over Israel for ever. 
\v 11 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the
house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee. 
\v 12 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge
concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the LORD thy God. 
\v 13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and
judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and
of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed. 
\v 14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the LORD an
hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver;
and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and
stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto. 
\v 15 Moreover \add there are\add* workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of
work. 
\v 16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, \add there is
\add* no number. Arise \add therefore,\add* and be doing, and the LORD be with
thee.
\p
\v 17 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son,
\add saying, \add*
\v 18 \add Is\add* not the LORD your God with you? and hath he \add not
\add* given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the
land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD, and before his
people. 
\v 19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise
therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the
covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to
be built to the name of the LORD.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over
Israel.
\p
\v 2 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and
the Levites. 
\v 3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward:
and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand. 
\v 4 Of which, twenty and four thousand \add were\add* to set forward the work
of the house of the LORD; and six thousand \add were\add* officers and
judges: 
\v 5 Moreover four thousand \add were\add* porters; and four thousand praised
the LORD with the instruments which I made, \add said David,\add* to praise 
\add therewith. \add*
\v 6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, \add namely,
\add* Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
\p
\v 7 Of the Gershonites \add were,\add* Laadan, and Shimei. 
\v 8 The sons of Laadan; the chief \add was\add* Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel,
three. 
\v 9 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three. These 
\add were\add* the chief of the fathers of Laadan. 
\v 10 And the sons of Shimei \add were,\add* Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and
Beriah. These four \add were\add* the sons of Shimei. 
\v 11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had
not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to \add their
\add* father’s house.
\p
\v 12 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four. 
\v 13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he
should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn
incense before the LORD, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for
ever. 
\v 14 Now \add concerning\add* Moses the man of God, his sons were named of
the tribe of Levi. 
\v 15 The sons of Moses \add were,\add* Gershom, and Eliezer. 
\v 16 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel \add was\add* the chief. 
\v 17 And the sons of Eliezer \add were,\add* Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer
had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many. 
\v 18 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief. 
\v 19 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second, Jahaziel
the third, and Jekameam the fourth. 
\v 20 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first, and Jesiah the second.
\p
\v 21 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli; Eleazar, and
Kish. 
\v 22 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their brethren the
sons of Kish took them. 
\v 23 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
\p
\v 24 These \add were\add* the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
\add even\add* the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of
names by their polls, that did the work for the service of the house of the
LORD, from the age of twenty years and upward. 
\v 25 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto his people,
that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever: 
\v 26 And also unto the Levites; they shall no \add more\add* carry the
tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof. 
\v 27 For by the last words of David the Levites \add were\add* numbered from
twenty years old and above: 
\v 28 Because their office \add was\add* to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in
the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of
God; 
\v 29 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat offering, and
for the unleavened cakes, and for \add that which is baked in\add* the pan,
and for that which is fried, and for all manner of measure and size; 
\v 30 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at
even; 
\v 31 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the sabbaths, in the
new moons, and on the set feasts, by number, according to the order commanded
unto them, continually before the LORD: 
\v 32 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and the charge of the holy \add place,\add* and the charge of
the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the house of the LORD.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Now \add these are\add* the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of
Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children:
therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office. 
\v 3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and
Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their
service. 
\v 4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the
sons of Ithamar; and \add thus\add* were they divided. Among the sons of
Eleazar \add there were\add* sixteen chief men of the house of \add their
\add* fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the house of
their fathers. 
\v 5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors
of the sanctuary, and governors \add of the house\add* of God, were of the
sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar. 
\v 6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, \add one\add* of the
Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest,
and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and \add before\add* the chief of the
fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for
Eleazar, and \add one\add* taken for Ithamar. 
\v 7 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah, 
\v 8 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim, 
\v 9 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin, 
\v 10 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah, 
\v 11 The ninth to Jeshua, the tenth to Shecaniah, 
\v 12 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim, 
\v 13 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab, 
\v 14 The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer, 
\v 15 The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses, 
\v 16 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel, 
\v 17 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, 
\v 18 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah. 
\v 19 These \add were\add* the orderings of them in their service to come into
the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron their father, as
the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.
\p
\v 20 And the rest of the sons of Levi \add were these:\add* Of the sons of
Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah. 
\v 21 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first \add was
\add* Isshiah. 
\v 22 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath. 
\v 23 And the sons \add of Hebron;\add* Jeriah \add the first,\add* Amariah
the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth. 
\v 24 \add Of\add* the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.
\v 25 The brother of Michah \add was\add* Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
Zechariah. 
\v 26 The sons of Merari \add were\add* Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah;
Beno.
\p
\v 27 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri. 
\v 28 Of Mahli \add came\add* Eleazar, who had no sons. 
\v 29 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish \add was\add* Jerahmeel. 
\v 30 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These \add were
\add* the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers. 
\v 31 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons of Aaron
in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of
the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over
against their younger brethren.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the service of
the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with
harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen
according to their service was: 
\v 2 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah,
the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the
order of the king. 
\v 3 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah,
Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who
prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD. 
\v 4 Of Heman: the sons of Heman; Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel, Shebuel, and
Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamti-ezer,
Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, \add and\add* Mahazioth: 
\v 5 All these \add were\add* the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words
of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three
daughters. 
\v 6 All these \add were\add* under the hands of their father for song 
\add in\add* the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for
the service of the house of God, according to the king’s order to Asaph,
Jeduthun, and Heman. 
\v 7 So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the
songs of the LORD, \add even\add* all that were cunning, was two hundred
fourscore and eight.
\p
\v 8 And they cast lots, ward against \add ward,\add* as well the small as the
great, the teacher as the scholar. 
\v 9 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to Gedaliah,
who with his brethren and sons \add were\add* twelve: 
\v 10 The third to Zaccur, \add he,\add* his sons, and his brethren, 
\add were\add* twelve:

\c 26
\p
\v 1 Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites \add was
\add* Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph. 
\v 2 And the sons of Meshelemiah \add were,\add* Zechariah the firstborn,
Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

\v 5 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth: for God

\v 6 Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the
house of their father: for they \add were\add* mighty men of valour. 
\v 7 The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad, whose
brethren \add were\add* strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah. 
\v 8 All these of the sons of Obed-edom: they and their sons and their
brethren, able men for strength for the service, \add were\add* threescore and
two of Obed-edom. 
\v 9 And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen. 
\v 10 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the chief, (for 
\add though\add* he was not the firstborn, yet his father made him the
chief;) 
\v 11 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth: all the
sons and brethren of Hosah \add were\add* thirteen. 
\v 12 Among these \add were\add* the divisions of the porters, \add even
\add* among the chief men, \add having\add* wards one against another, to
minister in the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 13 And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according to the
house of their fathers, for every gate. 
\v 14 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his son, a
wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out northward. 
\v 15 To Obed- edom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim. 
\v 16 To Shuppim and Hosah \add the lot came forth\add* westward, with the
gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward against ward. 
\v 17 Eastward \add were\add* six Levites, northward four a day, southward
four a day, and toward Asuppim two \add and\add* two. 
\v 18 At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, \add and\add* two at Parbar. 
\v 19 These \add are\add* the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore,
and among the sons of Merari.
\p
\v 20 And of the Levites, Ahijah \add was\add* over the treasures of the house
of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things. 
\v 21 \add As concerning\add* the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite
Laadan, chief fathers, \add even\add* of Laadan the Gershonite, \add were
\add* Jehieli. 
\v 22 The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, \add which were

\v 26 Which Shelomith and his brethren \add were\add* over all the treasures
of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief fathers, the
captains over thousands and hundreds, and the captains of the host, had
dedicated. 
\v 27 Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain the house
of the LORD. 
\v 28 And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and Abner the
son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had dedicated; \add and\add*
whosoever had dedicated \add any thing, it was\add* under the hand of
Shelomith, and of his brethren.
\p
\v 29 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons \add were\add* for the outward

\v 30 \add And\add* of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of

Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of the LORD, and in
the service of the king. 
\v 31 Among the Hebronites \add was\add* Jerijah the chief, \add even
\add* among the Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In
the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for, and there were
found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer of Gilead. 
\v 32 And his brethren, men of valour, \add were\add* two thousand and seven
hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the Reubenites, the
Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for every matter pertaining to God,
and affairs of the king.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 Now the children of Israel after their number, \add to wit,\add* the
chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that

\add were\add* twenty and four thousand. 
\v 5 The third captain of the host for the third month \add was\add* Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course \add were\add* twenty
and four thousand. 
\v 6 This \add is that\add* Benaiah, \add who was\add* mighty \add among
\add* the thirty, and above the thirty: and in his course \add was\add*
Ammizabad his son. 
\v 7 The fourth \add captain\add* for the fourth month \add was\add* Asahel
the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course 
\add were\add* twenty and four thousand. 
\v 8 The fifth captain for the fifth month \add was\add* Shamhuth the

\v 22 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These \add were\add* the princes of
the tribes of Israel.
\p
\v 23 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under:
because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the
heavens. 
\v 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because
there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the
account of the chronicles of king David.
\p
\v 25 And over the king’s treasures \add was\add* Azmaveth the son of Adiel:
and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages,

\v 30 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses 
\add was\add* Jehdeiah the Meronothite: 
\v 31 And over the flocks \add was\add* Jaziz the Hagerite. All these 
\add were\add* the rulers of the substance which \add was\add* king David’s. 
\v 32 Also Jonathan David’s uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe:
and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni \add was\add* with the king’s sons: 
\v 33 And Ahithophel \add was\add* the king’s counsellor: and Hushai the

\v 34 And after Ahithophel \add was\add* Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and
Abiathar: and the general of the king’s army \add was\add* Joab.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes,
and the captains of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and
the captains over the thousands, and captains over the hundreds, and the
stewards over all the substance and possession of the king, and of his sons,
with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto
Jerusalem. 
\v 2 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me, my
brethren, and my people: \add As for me,\add* I \add had\add* in mine heart to
build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the
footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building: 
\v 3 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name, because
thou \add hast been\add* a man of war, and hast shed blood. 
\v 4 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father
to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah \add to be
\add* the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among
the sons of my father he liked me to make \add me\add* king over all Israel: 
\v 5 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he hath
chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the LORD over
Israel. 
\v 6 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house and my
courts: for I have chosen him \add to be\add* my son, and I will be his
father. 
\v 7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be constant to do
my commandments and my judgments, as at this day. 
\v 8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the LORD,
and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the commandments of the
LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land, and leave \add it
\add* for an inheritance for your children after you for ever.
\p
\v 9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him
with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD searcheth all
hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek
him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
for ever. 
\v 10 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house for the
sanctuary: be strong, and do \add it.\add*
\p
\v 11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch, and of the
houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the upper chambers
thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the place of the mercy
seat, 
\v 12 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts of the
house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the treasuries of
the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated things: 
\v 13 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the
work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the vessels of
service in the house of the LORD. 
\v 14 \add He gave\add* of gold by weight for \add things\add* of gold, for
all instruments of all manner of service; \add silver also\add* for all
instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of
service: 
\v 15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their lamps of
gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps thereof: and for the
candlesticks of silver by weight, \add both\add* for the candlestick, and 
\add also\add* for the lamps thereof, according to the use of every
candlestick. 
\v 16 And by weight \add he gave\add* gold for the tables of shewbread, for
every table; and \add likewise\add* silver for the tables of silver: 
\v 17 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups: and for
the golden basons \add he gave gold\add* by weight for every bason; and 
\add likewise silver\add* by weight for every bason of silver: 
\v 18 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the
pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out \add their wings,
\add* and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD. 
\v 19 All \add this, said David,\add* the LORD made me understand in writing
by \add his\add* hand upon me, \add even\add* all the works of this pattern. 
\v 20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do
\add it:\add* fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, \add even
\add* my God, \add will be\add* with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake
thee, until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of
the LORD. 
\v 21 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, \add even they
shall be with thee\add* for all the service of the house of God: and 
\add there shall be\add* with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing
skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the people 
\add will be\add* wholly at thy commandment.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation, Solomon my
son, whom alone God hath chosen, \add is yet\add* young and tender, and the
work \add is\add* great: for the palace \add is\add* not for man, but for the
LORD God. 
\v 2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold
for \add things to be made\add* of gold, and the silver for \add things
\add* of silver, and the brass for \add things\add* of brass, the iron for 
\add things\add* of iron, and wood for \add things\add* of wood; onyx stones,
and \add stones\add* to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and
all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance. 
\v 3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have
of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, \add which\add* I have given to
the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy
house, 
\v 4 \add Even\add* three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses 
\add withal: \add*
\v 5 The gold for \add things\add* of gold, and the silver for \add things
\add* of silver, and for all manner of work \add to be made\add* by the hands
of artificers. And who \add then\add* is willing to consecrate his service
this day unto the LORD?
\p
\v 6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and
the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work,
offered willingly, 
\v 7 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand
talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of
brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron. 
\v 8 And they with whom \add precious\add* stones were found gave \add them
\add* to the treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the
Gershonite. 
\v 9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with
perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also
rejoiced with great joy.
\p
\v 10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David
said, Blessed \add be\add* thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and
ever. 
\v 11 Thine, O LORD, \add is\add* the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
and the victory, and the majesty: for all \add that is\add* in the heaven and
in the earth \add is thine;\add* thine \add is\add* the kingdom, O LORD, and
thou art exalted as head above all. 
\v 12 Both riches and honour \add come\add* of thee, and thou reignest over
all; and in thine hand \add is\add* power and might; and in thine hand 
\add it is\add* to make great, and to give strength unto all. 
\v 13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name. 
\v 14 But who \add am\add* I, and what \add is\add* my people, that we should
be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things \add come
\add* of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. 
\v 15 For we \add are\add* strangers before thee, and sojourners, as 
\add were\add* all our fathers: our days on the earth \add are\add* as a
shadow, and \add there is\add* none abiding. 
\v 16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an
house for thine holy name \add cometh\add* of thine hand, and \add is
\add* all thine own. 
\v 17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in
uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly
offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are
present here, to offer willingly unto thee. 
\v 18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for
ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and
prepare their heart unto thee: 
\v 19 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments,
thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all \add these things,
\add* and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.
\p
\v 20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And
all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down
their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king. 
\v 21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt
offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, \add even\add* a
thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, \add and\add* a thousand lambs, with their
drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel: 
\v 22 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness.
And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed 
\add him\add* unto the LORD \add to be\add* the chief governor, and Zadok 
\add to be\add* priest. 
\v 23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his
father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him. 
\v 24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of
king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king. 
\v 25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel,
and bestowed upon him \add such\add* royal majesty as had not been on any king
before him in Israel.
\p
\v 26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel. 
\v 27 And the time that he reigned over Israel \add was\add* forty years;
seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three \add years\add* reigned
he in Jerusalem. 
\v 28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honour: and
Solomon his son reigned in his stead. 
\v 29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they \add are
\add* written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the
prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer, 
\v 30 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and
over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.
