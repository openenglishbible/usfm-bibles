\mt The Third Book of Moses, called Leviticus 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle
of the congregation, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you
bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, 
\add even\add* of the herd, and of the flock. 
\v 3 If his offering \add be\add* a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer
a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD. 
\v 4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it
shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him. 
\v 5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s
sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar
that \add is by\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his pieces. 
\v 7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay
the wood in order upon the fire: 
\v 8 And the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the
fat, in order upon the wood that \add is\add* on the fire which \add is
\add* upon the altar: 
\v 9 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall
burn all on the altar, \add to be\add* a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by
fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\p
\v 10 And if his offering \add be\add* of the flocks, \add namely,\add* of the
sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male
without blemish. 
\v 11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD:
and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle his blood round about upon the
altar. 
\v 12 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his fat: and the
priest shall lay them in order on the wood that \add is\add* on the fire which
\add is\add* upon the altar: 
\v 13 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest
shall bring \add it\add* all, and burn \add it\add* upon the altar: it 
\add is\add* a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
unto the LORD.
\p
\v 14 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD \add be
\add* of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young
pigeons. 
\v 15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off his head,
and burn \add it\add* on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out
at the side of the altar: 
\v 16 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast it beside
the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes: 
\v 17 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, \add but\add* shall not
divide \add it\add* asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon
the wood that \add is\add* upon the fire: it \add is\add* a burnt sacrifice,
an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall
be \add of\add* fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put
frankincense thereon: 
\v 2 And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests: and he shall take
thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all
the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon
the altar, \add to be\add* an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
the LORD: 
\v 3 And the remnant of the meat offerings \add shall be\add* Aaron’s and his
sons’: \add it is\add* a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by
fire.
\p
\v 4 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, 
\add it shall be\add* unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or
unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
\p
\v 5 And if thy oblation \add be\add* a meat offering \add baken\add* in a
pan, it shall be \add of\add* fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. 
\v 6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it \add is
\add* a meat offering.
\p
\v 7 And if thy oblation \add be\add* a meat offering \add baken\add* in the
frying pan, it shall be made \add of\add* fine flour with oil. 
\v 8 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto
the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the
altar. 
\v 9 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and
shall burn \add it\add* upon the altar: \add it is\add* an offering made by
fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
\v 10 And that which is left of the meat offering \add shall be\add* Aaron’s
and his sons’: \add it is\add* a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD
made by fire. 
\v 11 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with
leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the
LORD made by fire.
\p
\v 12 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the
LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour. 
\v 13 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt;
neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking
from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. 
\v 14 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou
shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried
by the fire, \add even\add* corn beaten out of full ears. 
\v 15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it 
\add is\add* a meat offering. 
\v 16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, \add part\add* of the
beaten corn thereof, and \add part\add* of the oil thereof, with all the
frankincense thereof: \add it is\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And if his oblation \add be\add* a sacrifice of peace offering, if he
offer \add it\add* of the herd; whether \add it be\add* a male or female, he
shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. 
\v 2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it 
\add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons
the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering
made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat
that \add is\add* upon the inwards, 
\v 4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* on them, which 
\add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
shall he take away. 
\v 5 And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice,
which \add is\add* upon the wood that \add is\add* on the fire: \add it is
\add* an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\p
\v 6 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD 
\add be\add* of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.
\v 7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the
LORD. 
\v 8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it
before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle the
blood thereof round about upon the altar. 
\v 9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering
made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, \add and\add* the whole rump, it
shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards,
and all the fat that \add is\add* upon the inwards, 
\v 10 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* upon them, which 
\add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
shall he take away. 
\v 11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: \add it is\add* the food of
the offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\p
\v 12 And if his offering \add be\add* a goat, then he shall offer it before
the LORD. 
\v 13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the
tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood
thereof upon the altar round about. 
\v 14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, \add even\add* an offering made
by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that
\add is\add* upon the inwards, 
\v 15 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* upon them, which 
\add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
shall he take away. 
\v 16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: \add it is\add* the food
of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat \add is
\add* the LORD’S. 
\v 17 \add It shall be\add* a perpetual statute for your generations
throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through
ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD \add concerning things
\add* which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: 
\v 3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people;
then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without
blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering. 
\v 4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock’s head,
and kill the bullock before the LORD. 
\v 5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood, and
bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the
blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary. 
\v 7 And the priest shall put \add some\add* of the blood upon the horns of
the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which \add is\add* in the
tabernacle of the congregation: and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at
the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which \add is at\add* the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin
offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that \add is
\add* upon the inwards, 
\v 9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* upon them, which 
\add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
shall he take away, 
\v 10 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt
offering. 
\v 11 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with
his legs, and his inwards, and his dung, 
\v 12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a
clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with
fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.
\p
\v 13 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the
thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done \add somewhat
against\add* any of the commandments of the LORD \add concerning things
\add* which should not be done, and are guilty; 
\v 14 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the
congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the
tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head
of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the
LORD. 
\v 16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock’s blood to
the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 17 And the priest shall dip his finger \add in some\add* of the blood, and
sprinkle \add it\add* seven times before the LORD, \add even\add* before the
vail. 
\v 18 And he shall put \add some\add* of the blood upon the horns of the altar
which \add is\add* before the LORD, that \add is\add* in the tabernacle of the
congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of
the burnt offering, which \add is at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation. 
\v 19 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn \add it\add* upon the
altar. 
\v 20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin
offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for
them, and it shall be forgiven them. 
\v 21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as
he burned the first bullock: it \add is\add* a sin offering for the
congregation.
\p
\v 22 When a ruler hath sinned, and done \add somewhat\add* through ignorance
\add against\add* any of the commandments of the LORD his God \add concerning
things\add* which should not be done, and is guilty; 
\v 23 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall
bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish: 
\v 24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the
place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it \add is
\add* a sin offering. 
\v 25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his
finger, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering. 
\v 26 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the
sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 27 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he
doeth \add somewhat against\add* any of the commandments of the LORD 
\add concerning things\add* which ought not to be done, and be guilty; 
\v 28 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he
shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for
his sin which he hath sinned. 
\v 29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay
the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering. 
\v 30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put
\add it\add* upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out
all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar. 
\v 31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away
from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn 
\add it\add* upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest
shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him. 
\v 32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female
without blemish. 
\v 33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it
for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering 
\v 34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his
finger, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering,
and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar: 
\v 35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is
taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall
burn them upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the
LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath
committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

\p
\v 1 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and \add is
\add* a witness, whether he hath seen or known \add of it;\add* if he do not
utter \add it,\add* then he shall bear his iniquity. 
\v 2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether \add it be\add* a carcase
of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean
creeping things, and \add if\add* it be hidden from him; he also shall be
unclean, and guilty. 
\v 3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness \add it be
\add* that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he
knoweth \add of it,\add* then he shall be guilty. 
\v 4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with \add his\add* lips to do evil, or to
do good, whatsoever \add it be\add* that a man shall pronounce with an oath,
and it be hid from him; when he knoweth \add of it,\add* then he shall be
guilty in one of these. 
\v 5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these \add things,
\add* that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that \add thing: 
\add*
\v 6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his sin which
he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a
sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his
sin. 
\v 7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his
trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto
the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering. 
\v 8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer \add that
\add* which \add is\add* for the sin offering first, and wring off his head
from his neck, but shall not divide \add it\add* asunder: 
\v 9 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of
the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the
altar: it \add is\add* a sin offering. 
\v 10 And he shall offer the second \add for\add* a burnt offering, according
to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin
which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 11 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,
then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of
fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he
put \add any\add* frankincense thereon: for it \add is\add* a sin offering. 
\v 12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his
handful of it, \add even\add* a memorial thereof, and burn \add it\add* on the
altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it \add is
\add* a sin offering. 
\v 13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that
he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and \add the
remnant\add* shall be the priest’s, as a meat offering.
\p
\v 14 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 15 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy
things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram
without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver,
after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering: 
\v 16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy
thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and
the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass
offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 17 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to
be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he wist \add it\add* not, yet
is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity. 
\v 18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy
estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall
make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and wist 
\add it\add* not, and it shall be forgiven him. 
\v 19 It \add is\add* a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed
against the LORD.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his
neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a
thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour; 
\v 3 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth
falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein: 
\v 4 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall
restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath
deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing
which he found, 
\v 5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it
in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, \add and
\add* give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass
offering. 
\v 6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without
blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto
the priest: 
\v 7 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it
shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in trespassing
therein.
\p
\v 8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 9 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This \add is\add* the law of the
burnt offering: It \add is\add* the burnt offering, because of the burning
upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be
burning in it. 
\v 10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches
shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath
consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside
the altar. 
\v 11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry
forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place. 
\v 12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put
out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt
offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace
offerings. 
\v 13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.
\p
\v 14 And this \add is\add* the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron
shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar. 
\v 15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat offering,
and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which \add is\add* upon the
meat offering, and shall burn \add it\add* upon the altar \add for\add* a
sweet savour, \add even\add* the memorial of it, unto the LORD. 
\v 16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened
bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of
the congregation they shall eat it. 
\v 17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it \add unto them for
\add* their portion of my offerings made by fire; it \add is\add* most holy,
as \add is\add* the sin offering, and as the trespass offering. 
\v 18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. \add It shall
be\add* a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the
LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.
\p
\v 19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 20 This \add is\add* the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they
shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an
ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the morning,
and half thereof at night. 
\v 21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; \add and when it is\add* baken, thou
shalt bring it in: \add and\add* the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt
thou offer \add for\add* a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
\v 22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it:
\add it is\add* a statute for ever unto the LORD, it shall be wholly burnt. 
\v 23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall
not be eaten.
\p
\v 24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 25 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This \add is\add* the law of
the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the
sin offering be killed before the LORD: it \add is\add* most holy. 
\v 26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place
shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there
is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that
whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place. 
\v 28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and if it
be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water. 
\v 29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it \add is
\add* most holy. 
\v 30 And no sin offering, whereof \add any\add* of the blood is brought into
the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile \add withal\add* in the holy 
\add place,\add* shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Likewise this \add is\add* the law of the trespass offering: it 
\add is\add* most holy. 
\v 2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the
trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon
the altar. 
\v 3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that
covereth the inwards, 
\v 4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* on them, which 
\add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul \add that is\add* above the liver,
with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 
\v 5 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar \add for\add* an offering
made by fire unto the LORD: it \add is\add* a trespass offering. 
\v 6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the
holy place: it \add is\add* most holy. 
\v 7 As the sin offering \add is,\add* so \add is\add* the trespass offering:
\add there is\add* one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement
therewith shall have \add it. \add*
\v 8 And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, \add even
\add* the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he
hath offered. 
\v 9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is
dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth
it. 
\v 10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons
of Aaron have, one \add as much\add* as another. 
\v 11 And this \add is\add* the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
he shall offer unto the LORD. 
\v 12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened
wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried. 
\v 13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer \add for\add* his offering leavened
bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings. 
\v 14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation \add for
\add* an heave offering unto the LORD, \add and\add* it shall be the priest’s
that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings. 
\v 15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving
shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it
until the morning. 
\v 16 But if the sacrifice of his offering \add be\add* a vow, or a voluntary
offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and
on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten: 
\v 17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall
be burnt with fire. 
\v 18 And if \add any\add* of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither
shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and
the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. 
\v 19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean \add thing\add* shall not be
eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean
shall eat thereof. 
\v 20 But the soul that eateth \add of\add* the flesh of the sacrifice of
peace offerings, that \add pertain\add* unto the LORD, having his uncleanness
upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean \add thing, as
\add* the uncleanness of man, or \add any\add* unclean beast, or any
abominable unclean \add thing,\add* and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of
peace offerings, which \add pertain\add* unto the LORD, even that soul shall
be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 23 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of
fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat. 
\v 24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which
is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat
of it. 
\v 25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth \add it
\add* shall be cut off from his people. 
\v 26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, \add whether it be\add* of
fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. 
\v 27 Whatsoever soul \add it be\add* that eateth any manner of blood, even
that soul shall be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 28 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 29 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the
sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto
the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. 
\v 30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the
fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved 
\add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD. 
\v 31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall
be Aaron’s and his sons’. 
\v 32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest \add for
\add* an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 
\v 33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for \add his\add* part.
\v 34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children
of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given
them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among
the children of Israel.
\p
\v 35 This \add is the portion\add* of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the
day \add when\add* he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest’s
office; 
\v 36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in
the day that he anointed them, \add by\add* a statute for ever throughout
their generations. 
\v 37 This \add is\add* the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering,
and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the
consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 
\v 38 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he
commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in
the wilderness of Sinai.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing
oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of
unleavened bread; 
\v 3 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered
together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This \add is\add* the thing which
the LORD commanded to be done. 
\v 6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water. 
\v 7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed
him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the
curious girdle of the ephod, and bound \add it\add* unto him therewith. 
\v 8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the
Urim and the Thummim. 
\v 9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, \add even
\add* upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the
LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all
that \add was\add* therein, and sanctified them. 
\v 11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the
altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his foot, to sanctify them. 
\v 12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him,
to sanctify him. 
\v 13 And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them
with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons
laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering. 
\v 15 And he slew \add it;\add* and Moses took the blood, and put \add it
\add* upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified
the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it,
to make reconciliation upon it. 
\v 16 And he took all the fat that \add was\add* upon the inwards, and caul 
\add above\add* the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses
burned \add it\add* upon the altar. 
\v 17 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with
fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 18 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons
laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 19 And he killed \add it;\add* and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
round about. 
\v 20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the
pieces, and the fat. 
\v 21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the
whole ram upon the altar: it \add was\add* a burnt sacrifice for a sweet
savour, \add and\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD
commanded Moses.
\p
\v 22 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his
sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 23 And he slew \add it;\add* and Moses took of the blood of it, and put 
\add it\add* upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his
right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot. 
\v 24 And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of
their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great
toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round
about. 
\v 25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that \add was
\add* upon the inwards, and the caul \add above\add* the liver, and the two
kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder: 
\v 26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that \add was\add* before the
LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer,
and put \add them\add* on the fat, and upon the right shoulder: 
\v 27 And he put all upon Aaron’s hands, and upon his sons’ hands, and waved
them \add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD. 
\v 28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt \add them
\add* on the altar upon the burnt offering: they \add were\add* consecrations
for a sweet savour: it \add is\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
\v 29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it \add for\add* a wave offering
before the LORD: \add for\add* of the ram of consecration it was Moses’ part;
as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which \add was
\add* upon the altar, and sprinkled \add it\add* upon Aaron, \add and
\add* upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with
him; and sanctified Aaron, \add and\add* his garments, and his sons, and his
sons’ garments with him.
\p
\v 31 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that 
\add is\add* in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and
his sons shall eat it. 
\v 32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn
with fire. 
\v 33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation \add in\add* seven days, until the days of your consecration be
at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you. 
\v 34 As he hath done this day, \add so\add* the LORD hath commanded to do, to
make an atonement for you. 
\v 35 Therefore shall ye abide \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that
ye die not: for so I am commanded. 
\v 36 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded by the
hand of Moses.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass on the eighth day, \add that\add* Moses called Aaron
and his sons, and the elders of Israel; 
\v 2 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a
ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer \add them\add* before the
LORD. 
\v 3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid
of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, \add both\add* of the
first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering; 
\v 4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the
LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear
unto you.
\p
\v 5 And they brought \add that\add* which Moses commanded before the
tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood
before the LORD. 
\v 6 And Moses said, This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD commanded that
ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you. 
\v 7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering,
and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people:
and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the
LORD commanded.
\p
\v 8 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin
offering, which \add was\add* for himself. 
\v 9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his
finger in the blood, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar, and
poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar: 
\v 10 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin
offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp. 
\v 12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the
blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar. 
\v 13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof,
and the head: and he burnt \add them\add* upon the altar. 
\v 14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt \add them
\add* upon the burnt offering on the altar.
\p
\v 15 And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which 
\add was\add* the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for
sin, as the first. 
\v 16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the
manner. 
\v 17 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt
\add it\add* upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning. 
\v 18 He slew also the bullock and the ram \add for\add* a sacrifice of peace
offerings, which \add was\add* for the people: and Aaron’s sons presented unto
him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about, 
\v 19 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which
covereth \add the inwards,\add* and the kidneys, and the caul \add above
\add* the liver: 
\v 20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the
altar: 
\v 21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved \add for\add* a wave
offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded. 
\v 22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and
came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace
offerings. 
\v 23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and
came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all
the people. 
\v 24 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed upon the
altar the burnt offering and the fat: \add which\add* when all the people saw,
they shouted, and fell on their faces.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them his censer,
and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and offered strange fire before
the LORD, which he commanded them not. 
\v 2 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and they died
before the LORD. 
\v 3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This \add is it\add* that the LORD spake,
saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the
people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace. 
\v 4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of
Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the
sanctuary out of the camp. 
\v 5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as
Moses had said. 
\v 6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons,
Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath
come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel,
bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled. 
\v 7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD \add is
\add* upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.
\p
\v 8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 9 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye
go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: \add it shall be
\add* a statute for ever throughout your generations: 
\v 10 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between
unclean and clean; 
\v 11 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the
LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
\p
\v 12 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons
that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the
LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it 
\add is\add* most holy: 
\v 13 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it \add is\add* thy due,
and thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am
commanded. 
\v 14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place;
thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for \add they be\add* thy
due, and thy sons’ due, \add which\add* are given out of the sacrifices of
peace offerings of the children of Israel. 
\v 15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the
offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave \add it for\add* a wave offering
before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by a statute
for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.
\p
\v 16 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold,
it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron 
\add which were\add* left \add alive,\add* saying, 
\v 17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing
it \add is\add* most holy, and \add God\add* hath given it you to bear the
iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD? 
\v 18 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy \add place:
\add* ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy \add place,\add* as I
commanded. 
\v 19 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered their sin
offering and their burnt offering before the LORD; and such things have
befallen me: and \add if\add* I had eaten the sin offering to day, should it
have been accepted in the sight of the LORD? 
\v 20 And when Moses heard \add that,\add* he was content.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These \add are\add* the beasts
which ye shall eat among all the beasts that \add are\add* on the earth. 
\v 3 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, \add and\add* cheweth
the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat. 
\v 4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them
that divide the hoof: \add as\add* the camel, because he cheweth the cud, but
divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto you. 
\v 5 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he
\add is\add* unclean unto you. 
\v 6 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he 
\add is\add* unclean unto you. 
\v 7 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted, yet he
cheweth not the cud; he \add is\add* unclean to you. 
\v 8 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye not touch;
they \add are\add* unclean to you.
\p
\v 9 These shall ye eat of all that \add are\add* in the waters: whatsoever
hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them shall
ye eat. 
\v 10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of
all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which \add is\add* in the
waters, they \add shall be\add* an abomination unto you: 
\v 11 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their
flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination. 
\v 12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that \add shall be
\add* an abomination unto you.
\p
\v 13 And these \add are they which ye\add* shall have in abomination among
the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they \add are\add* an abomination: the
eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray, 
\v 14 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind; 
\v 15 Every raven after his kind; 
\v 16 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his
kind, 
\v 17 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl, 
\v 18 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle, 
\v 19 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the bat. 
\v 20 All fowls that creep, going upon \add all\add* four, \add shall be
\add* an abomination unto you. 
\v 21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon 
\add all\add* four, which have legs above their feet, to leap withal upon the
earth; 
\v 22 \add Even\add* these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and
the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind, and the
grasshopper after his kind. 
\v 23 But all \add other\add* flying creeping things, which have four feet, 
\add shall be\add* an abomination unto you. 
\v 24 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of
them shall be unclean until the even. 
\v 25 And whosoever beareth \add ought\add* of the carcase of them shall wash
his clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
\v 26 \add The carcases\add* of every beast which divideth the hoof, and 
\add is\add* not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, \add are\add* unclean unto
you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean. 
\v 27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go
on \add all\add* four, those \add are\add* unclean unto you: whoso toucheth
their carcase shall be unclean until the even. 
\v 28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be
unclean until the even: they \add are\add* unclean unto you.
\p
\v 29 These also \add shall be\add* unclean unto you among the creeping things
that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after
his kind, 
\v 30 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and
the mole. 
\v 31 These \add are\add* unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth
touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even. 
\v 32 And upon whatsoever \add any\add* of them, when they are dead, doth
fall, it shall be unclean; whether \add it be\add* any vessel of wood, or
raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel \add it be,\add* wherein 
\add any\add* work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean
until the even; so it shall be cleansed. 
\v 33 And every earthen vessel, whereinto \add any\add* of them falleth,
whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it. 
\v 34 Of all meat which may be eaten, \add that\add* on which \add such
\add* water cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in every
\add such\add* vessel shall be unclean. 
\v 35 And every \add thing\add* whereupon \add any part\add* of their carcase
falleth shall be unclean; \add whether it be\add* oven, or ranges for pots,
they shall be broken down: \add for\add* they \add are\add* unclean, and shall
be unclean unto you. 
\v 36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, \add wherein there is\add* plenty of
water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be
unclean. 
\v 37 And if \add any part\add* of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed
which is to be sown, it \add shall be\add* clean. 
\v 38 But if \add any\add* water be put upon the seed, and \add any part
\add* of their carcase fall thereon, it \add shall be\add* unclean unto you. 
\v 39 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase
thereof shall be unclean until the even. 
\v 40 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be
unclean until the even: he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his
clothes, and be unclean until the even. 
\v 41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth \add shall be
\add* an abomination; it shall not be eaten. 
\v 42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon \add all
\add* four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep
upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they \add are\add* an abomination.
\v 43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that
creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should
be defiled thereby. 
\v 44 For I \add am\add* the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I \add am\add* holy: neither shall ye
defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the
earth. 
\v 45 For I \add am\add* the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of
Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I \add am\add* holy. 
\v 46 This \add is\add* the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth
upon the earth: 
\v 47 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the
beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived
seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to
the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean. 
\v 3 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised. 
\v 4 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and
thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary,
until the days of her purifying be fulfilled. 
\v 5 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in
her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying
threescore and six days. 
\v 6 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a
daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a
young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest: 
\v 7 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and
she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood. This \add is\add* the law
for her that hath born a male or a female. 
\v 8 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles,
or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin
offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be
clean.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or a
bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh \add like\add* the plague of
leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of his
sons the priests: 
\v 3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and 
\add when\add* the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight
\add be\add* deeper than the skin of his flesh, it \add is\add* a plague of
leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. 
\v 4 If the bright spot \add be\add* white in the skin of his flesh, and in
sight \add be\add* not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not
turned white; then the priest shall shut up \add him that hath\add* the plague
seven days: 
\v 5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, 
\add if\add* the plague in his sight be at a stay, \add and\add* the plague
spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more: 
\v 6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, 
\add if\add* the plague \add be\add* somewhat dark, \add and\add* the plague
spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it \add is but
\add* a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 
\v 7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he hath been
seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again: 
\v 8 And \add if\add* the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* a leprosy.
\p
\v 9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the
priest; 
\v 10 And the priest shall see \add him:\add* and, behold, \add if\add* the
rising \add be\add* white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and
\add there be\add* quick raw flesh in the rising; 
\v 11 It \add is\add* an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest
shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he \add is
\add* unclean. 
\v 12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all
the skin of \add him that hath\add* the plague from his head even to his foot,
wheresoever the priest looketh; 
\v 13 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, \add if\add* the leprosy
have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce \add him\add* clean \add that
hath\add* the plague: it is all turned white: he \add is\add* clean. 
\v 14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean. 
\v 15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean:
\add for\add* the raw flesh \add is\add* unclean: it \add is\add* a leprosy. 
\v 16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come
unto the priest; 
\v 17 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, \add if\add* the plague be
turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce \add him\add* clean 
\add that hath\add* the plague: he \add is\add* clean.
\p
\v 18 The flesh also, in which, \add even\add* in the skin thereof, was a
boil, and is healed, 
\v 19 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot,
white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the priest; 
\v 20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it \add be\add* in sight lower
than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall
pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* a plague of leprosy broken out of the
boil. 
\v 21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, \add there be\add* no white
hairs therein, and \add if\add* it \add be\add* not lower than the skin, but 
\add be\add* somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days: 
\v 22 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* a plague. 
\v 23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, \add and\add* spread not, it 
\add is\add* a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
\p
\v 24 Or if there be \add any\add* flesh, in the skin whereof \add there is
\add* a hot burning, and the quick \add flesh\add* that burneth have a white
bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white; 
\v 25 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, \add if\add* the hair
in the bright spot be turned white, and it \add be in\add* sight deeper than
the skin; it \add is\add* a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the
priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* the plague of leprosy. 
\v 26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, \add there be\add* no white
hair in the bright spot, and it \add be\add* no lower than the \add other
\add* skin, but \add be\add* somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up
seven days: 
\v 27 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: \add and\add* if it
be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean: it \add is\add* the plague of leprosy. 
\v 28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, \add and\add* spread not in
the skin, but it \add be\add* somewhat dark; it \add is\add* a rising of the
burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it \add is\add* an
inflammation of the burning.
\p
\v 29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard; 
\v 30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it \add be
\add* in sight deeper than the skin; \add and there be\add* in it a yellow
thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* a dry
scall, \add even\add* a leprosy upon the head or beard. 
\v 31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it 
\add be\add* not in sight deeper than the skin, and \add that there is
\add* no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up \add him that hath
\add* the plague of the scall seven days: 
\v 32 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold,
\add if\add* the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the
scall \add be\add* not in sight deeper than the skin; 
\v 33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest
shall shut up \add him that hath\add* the scall seven days more: 
\v 34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold,
\add if\add* the scall be not spread in the skin, nor \add be\add* in sight
deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall
wash his clothes, and be clean. 
\v 35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing; 
\v 36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread
in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he \add is\add*
unclean. 
\v 37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and \add that\add* there is
black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he \add is\add* clean: and
the priest shall pronounce him clean.
\p
\v 38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, 
\add even\add* white bright spots; 
\v 39 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, \add if\add* the bright spots
in the skin of their flesh \add be\add* darkish white; it \add is\add* a
freckled spot \add that\add* groweth in the skin; he \add is\add* clean. 
\v 40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he \add is\add* bald; 
\add yet is\add* he clean. 
\v 41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward
his face, he \add is\add* forehead bald: \add yet is\add* he clean. 
\v 42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish
sore; it \add is\add* a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald
forehead. 
\v 43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, \add if\add* the rising
of the sore \add be\add* white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald
forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh; 
\v 44 He is a leprous man, he \add is\add* unclean: the priest shall pronounce
him utterly unclean; his plague \add is\add* in his head. 
\v 45 And the leper in whom the plague \add is,\add* his clothes shall be
rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and
shall cry, Unclean, unclean. 
\v 46 All the days wherein the plague \add shall be\add* in him he shall be
defiled; he \add is\add* unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp 
\add shall\add* his habitation \add be.\add*
\p
\v 47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, \add whether it be
\add* a woollen garment, or a linen garment; 
\v 48 Whether \add it be\add* in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;
whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin; 
\v 49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin,
either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it \add is
\add* a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest: 
\v 50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up \add it that
hath\add* the plague seven days: 
\v 51 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be
spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, 
\add or\add* in any work that is made of skin; the plague \add is\add* a
fretting leprosy; it \add is\add* unclean. 
\v 52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen
or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it \add is
\add* a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire. 
\v 53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in
the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; 
\v 54 Then the priest shall command that they wash \add the thing\add* wherein
the plague \add is,\add* and he shall shut it up seven days more: 
\v 55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and,
behold, \add if\add* the plague have not changed his colour, and the plague be
not spread; it \add is\add* unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it 
\add is\add* fret inward, \add whether\add* it \add be\add* bare within or
without. 
\v 56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague \add be\add* somewhat
dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out
of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof: 
\v 57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
woof, or in any thing of skin; it \add is\add* a spreading \add plague:
\add* thou shalt burn that wherein the plague \add is\add* with fire. 
\v 58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin 
\add it be,\add* which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them,
then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean. 
\v 59 This \add is\add* the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to
pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall
be brought unto the priest: 
\v 3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look,
and, behold, \add if\add* the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper; 
\v 4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two
birds alive \add and\add* clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop: 
\v 5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an
earthen vessel over running water: 
\v 6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the
scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood
of the bird \add that was\add* killed over the running water: 
\v 7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy
seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird
loose into the open field. 
\v 8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all
his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he
shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days. 
\v 9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off
his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off:
and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he
shall be clean. 
\v 10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and
one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine
flour \add for\add* a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil. 
\v 11 And the priest that maketh \add him\add* clean shall present the man
that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD, \add at
\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 12 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass
offering, and the log of oil, and wave them \add for\add* a wave offering
before the LORD: 
\v 13 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin
offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering 
\add is\add* the priest’s, \add so is\add* the trespass offering: it 
\add is\add* most holy: 
\v 14 And the priest shall take \add some\add* of the blood of the trespass
offering, and the priest shall put \add it\add* upon the tip of the right ear
of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon
the great toe of his right foot: 
\v 15 And the priest shall take \add some\add* of the log of oil, and pour 
\add it\add* into the palm of his own left hand: 
\v 16 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that \add is
\add* in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven
times before the LORD: 
\v 17 And of the rest of the oil that \add is\add* in his hand shall the
priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and
upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot,
upon the blood of the trespass offering: 
\v 18 And the remnant of the oil that \add is\add* in the priest’s hand he
shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall
make an atonement for him before the LORD. 
\v 19 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an atonement for
him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill
the burnt offering: 
\v 20 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat offering upon
the altar: and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and he shall be
clean. 
\v 21 And if he \add be\add* poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take
one lamb \add for\add* a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement
for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat
offering, and a log of oil; 
\v 22 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get;
and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a burnt offering. 
\v 23 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing unto the
priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the LORD.
\v 24 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering, and the log
of oil, and the priest shall wave them \add for\add* a wave offering before
the LORD: 
\v 25 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the priest
shall take \add some\add* of the blood of the trespass offering, and put 
\add it\add* upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and
upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot: 
\v 26 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left
hand: 
\v 27 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger \add some
\add* of the oil that \add is\add* in his left hand seven times before the
LORD: 
\v 28 And the priest shall put of the oil that \add is\add* in his hand upon
the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of
his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the place of
the blood of the trespass offering: 
\v 29 And the rest of the oil that \add is\add* in the priest’s hand he shall
put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an atonement for him
before the LORD. 
\v 30 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons,
such as he can get; 
\v 31 \add Even\add* such as he is able to get, the one \add for\add* a sin
offering, and the other \add for\add* a burnt offering, with the meat
offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be
cleansed before the LORD. 
\v 32 This \add is\add* the law \add of him\add* in whom \add is\add* the
plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get \add that which pertaineth
\add* to his cleansing.
\p
\v 33 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 34 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you for a
possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your
possession; 
\v 35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It
seemeth to me \add there is\add* as it were a plague in the house: 
\v 36 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house, before the
priest go \add into it\add* to see the plague, that all that \add is
\add* in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest shall go in
to see the house: 
\v 37 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, \add if\add* the plague 
\add be\add* in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or
reddish, which in sight \add are\add* lower than the wall; 
\v 38 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house, and
shut up the house seven days: 
\v 39 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall look: and,
behold, \add if\add* the plague be spread in the walls of the house; 
\v 40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which
the plague \add is,\add* and they shall cast them into an unclean place
without the city: 
\v 41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they
shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean
place: 
\v 42 And they shall take other stones, and put \add them\add* in the place of
those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall plaister the house. 
\v 43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he
hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it
is plaistered; 
\v 44 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, \add if\add* the
plague be spread in the house, it \add is\add* a fretting leprosy in the
house: it is unclean. 
\v 45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber
thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall carry \add them
\add* forth out of the city into an unclean place. 
\v 46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up
shall be unclean until the even. 
\v 47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that
eateth in the house shall wash his clothes. 
\v 48 And if the priest shall come in, and look \add upon it,\add* and,
behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was
plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the
plague is healed. 
\v 49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and
scarlet, and hyssop: 
\v 50 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over running
water: 
\v 51 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet, and
the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird, and in the
running water, and sprinkle the house seven times: 
\v 52 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with the
running water, and with the living bird, and with the cedar wood, and with the
hyssop, and with the scarlet: 
\v 53 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open
fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall be clean. 
\v 54 This \add is\add* the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and
scall, 
\v 55 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house, 
\v 56 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot: 
\v 57 To teach when \add it is\add* unclean, and when \add it is\add* clean:
this \add is\add* the law of leprosy.

\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any man hath a
running issue out of his flesh, \add because of\add* his issue he \add is
\add* unclean. 
\v 3 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh run
with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his issue, it \add is\add* his
uncleanness. 
\v 4 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean: and every
thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean. 
\v 5 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe 
\add himself\add* in water, and be unclean until the even. 
\v 6 And he that sitteth on \add any\add* thing whereon he sat that hath the
issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe \add himself\add* in water, and be
unclean until the even. 
\v 7 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue shall wash his
clothes, and bathe \add himself\add* in water, and be unclean until the even.
\v 8 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean; then he shall
wash his clothes, and bathe \add himself\add* in water, and be unclean until
the even. 
\v 9 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue shall be
unclean. 
\v 10 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be unclean
until the even: and he that beareth \add any of\add* those things shall wash
his clothes, and bathe \add himself\add* in water, and be unclean until the
even. 
\v 11 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not rinsed his
hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and bathe \add himself\add* in
water, and be unclean until the even. 
\v 12 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the issue, shall be
broken: and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water. 
\v 13 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall
number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and wash his clothes, and
bathe his flesh in running water, and shall be clean. 
\v 14 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or two young
pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and give them unto the priest: 
\v 15 And the priest shall offer them, the one \add for\add* a sin offering,
and the other \add for\add* a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an
atonement for him before the LORD for his issue. 
\v 16 And if any man’s seed of copulation go out from him, then he shall wash
all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the even. 
\v 17 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of copulation,
shall be washed with water, and be unclean until the even. 
\v 18 The woman also with whom man shall lie \add with\add* seed of
copulation, they shall \add both\add* bathe \add themselves\add* in water, and
be unclean until the even.
\p
\v 19 And if a woman have an issue, \add and\add* her issue in her flesh be
blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever toucheth her shall be
unclean until the even. 
\v 20 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be unclean:
every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be unclean. 
\v 21 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe 
\add himself\add* in water, and be unclean until the even. 
\v 22 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash his
clothes, and bathe \add himself\add* in water, and be unclean until the even.
\v 23 And if it \add be\add* on \add her\add* bed, or on any thing whereon she
sitteth, when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even. 
\v 24 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon him, he
shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon he lieth \add shall be
\add* unclean. 
\v 25 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of
her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days
of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she
shall be unclean. 
\v 26 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be unto her
as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she sitteth upon shall be
unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation. 
\v 27 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his
clothes, and bathe \add himself\add* in water, and be unclean until the even.
\v 28 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to herself
seven days, and after that she shall be clean. 
\v 29 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or two young
pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation. 
\v 30 And the priest shall offer the one \add for\add* a sin offering, and the
other \add for\add* a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an atonement
for her before the LORD for the issue of her uncleanness. 
\v 31 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness;
that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that 
\add is\add* among them. 
\v 32 This \add is\add* the law of him that hath an issue, and \add of him
\add* whose seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith; 
\v 33 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath an issue,
of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth with her that is unclean.

\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron,
when they offered before the LORD, and died; 
\v 2 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that he come
not at all times into the holy \add place\add* within the vail before the
mercy seat, which \add is\add* upon the ark; that he die not: for I will
appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat. 
\v 3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy \add place:\add* with a young bullock
for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering. 
\v 4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen breeches
upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen
mitre shall he be attired: these \add are\add* holy garments; therefore shall
he wash his flesh in water, and \add so\add* put them on. 
\v 5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel two kids
of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering. 
\v 6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which \add is
\add* for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house. 
\v 7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the LORD 
\add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the LORD, and
the other lot for the scapegoat. 
\v 9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD’S lot fell, and offer
him \add for\add* a sin offering. 
\v 10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be
presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, \add and
\add* to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. 
\v 11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which \add is
\add* for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house,
and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which \add is\add* for
himself: 
\v 12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from off the
altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense beaten small, and
bring \add it\add* within the vail: 
\v 13 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD, that the
cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that \add is\add* upon the
testimony, that he die not: 
\v 14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle \add it
\add* with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat
shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
\p
\v 15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that \add is
\add* for the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that
blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy
seat, and before the mercy seat: 
\v 16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy \add place,\add* because of
the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions
in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle of the congregation,
that remaineth among them in the midst of their uncleanness. 
\v 17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation when he
goeth in to make an atonement in the holy \add place,\add* until he come out,
and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and for all the
congregation of Israel. 
\v 18 And he shall go out unto the altar that \add is\add* before the LORD,
and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock, and
of the blood of the goat, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar
round about. 
\v 19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times,
and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy \add place,
\add* and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring
the live goat: 
\v 21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat, and
confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their
transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the goat, and
shall send \add him\add* away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness: 
\v 22 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not
inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness. 
\v 23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall
put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into the holy 
\add place,\add* and shall leave them there: 
\v 24 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and put on his
garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and the burnt offering
of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and for the people. 
\v 25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar. 
\v 26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes,
and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the camp. 
\v 27 And the bullock \add for\add* the sin offering, and the goat \add for
\add* the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the
holy \add place,\add* shall \add one\add* carry forth without the camp; and
they shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung. 
\v 28 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in
water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
\p
\v 29 And \add this\add* shall be a statute for ever unto you: \add that
\add* in the seventh month, on the tenth \add day\add* of the month, ye shall
afflict your souls, and do no work at all, \add whether it be\add* one of your
own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you: 
\v 30 For on that day shall \add the priest\add* make an atonement for you, to
cleanse you, \add that\add* ye may be clean from all your sins before the
LORD. 
\v 31 It \add shall be\add* a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
your souls, by a statute for ever. 
\v 32 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall consecrate to
minister in the priest’s office in his father’s stead, shall make the
atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, \add even\add* the holy
garments: 
\v 33 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make
an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he
shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
congregation. 
\v 34 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an atonement
for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And he did as the
LORD commanded Moses.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children of Israel,
and say unto them; This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD hath commanded,
saying, 
\v 3 What man soever \add there be\add* of the house of Israel, that killeth
an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth \add it\add* out of the
camp, 
\v 4 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
to offer an offering unto the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood
shall be imputed unto that man; he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut
off from among his people: 
\v 5 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their sacrifices, which
they offer in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the LORD,
unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest, and
offer them \add for\add* peace offerings unto the LORD. 
\v 6 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the LORD 
\add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and burn the fat
for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
\v 7 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom
they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute for ever unto them
throughout their generations.
\p
\v 8 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man \add there be\add* of the
house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you, that offereth a
burnt offering of sacrifice, 
\v 9 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,
to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his
people.
\p
\v 10 And whatsoever man \add there be\add* of the house of Israel, or of the
strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of blood; I will even
set my face against that soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from
among his people. 
\v 11 For the life of the flesh \add is\add* in the blood: and I have given it
to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it \add is
\add* the blood \add that\add* maketh an atonement for the soul. 
\v 12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat
blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood. 
\v 13 And whatsoever man \add there be\add* of the children of Israel, or of
the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or
fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it
with dust. 
\v 14 For \add it is\add* the life of all flesh; the blood of it \add is
\add* for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye
shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh 
\add is\add* the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off. 
\v 15 And every soul that eateth that which died \add of itself,\add* or that
which was torn \add with beasts, whether it be\add* one of your own country,
or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe \add himself
\add* in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean. 
\v 16 But if he wash \add them\add* not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall
bear his iniquity.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the LORD your
God. 
\v 3 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do:
and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither I bring you, shall ye not
do: neither shall ye walk in their ordinances. 
\v 4 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I 
\add am\add* the LORD your God. 
\v 5 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do,
he shall live in them: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 6 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him, to uncover
\add their\add* nakedness: I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 7 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, shalt thou
not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
\v 8 The nakedness of thy father’s wife shalt thou not uncover: it is thy
father’s nakedness. 
\v 9 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or daughter of
thy mother, \add whether she be\add* born at home, or born abroad, \add even
\add* their nakedness thou shalt not uncover. 
\v 10 The nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or of thy daughter’s daughter, 
\add even\add* their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for theirs \add is
\add* thine own nakedness. 
\v 11 The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father,
she \add is\add* thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
\v 12 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: she 
\add is\add* thy father’s near kinswoman. 
\v 13 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: for she 
\add is\add* thy mother’s near kinswoman. 
\v 14 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, thou shalt
not approach to his wife: she \add is\add* thine aunt. 
\v 15 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law: she 
\add is\add* thy son’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness. 
\v 16 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife: it 
\add is\add* thy brother’s nakedness. 
\v 17 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter,
neither shalt thou take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to
uncover her nakedness; \add for\add* they \add are\add* her near kinswomen: it
\add is\add* wickedness. 
\v 18 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex \add her,
\add* to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life \add time. 
\add*
\v 19 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as
long as she is put apart for her uncleanness. 
\v 20 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour’s wife, to
defile thyself with her. 
\v 21 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through \add the fire
\add* to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I \add am
\add* the LORD. 
\v 22 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it \add is
\add* abomination. 
\v 23 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith:
neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie down thereto: it 
\add is\add* confusion. 
\v 24 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the
nations are defiled which I cast out before you: 
\v 25 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity thereof upon
it, and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants. 
\v 26 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and shall not
commit \add any\add* of these abominations; \add neither\add* any of your own
nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you: 
\v 27 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which 
\add were\add* before you, and the land is defiled;) 
\v 28 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it spued out
the nations that \add were\add* before you. 
\v 29 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls
that commit \add them\add* shall be cut off from among their people. 
\v 30 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that \add ye\add* commit not 
\add any one\add* of these abominable customs, which were committed before
you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I \add am\add* the LORD your
God.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto
them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God \add am\add* holy.
\p
\v 3 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths:
I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 4 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I \add am
\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 5 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall
offer it at your own will. 
\v 6 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if
ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire. 
\v 7 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it \add is\add* abominable;
it shall not be accepted. 
\v 8 Therefore \add every one\add* that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall
be cut off from among his people.
\p
\v 9 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the
corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.
\v 10 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather 
\add every\add* grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and
stranger: I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 11 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.
\p
\v 12 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou profane
the name of thy God: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 13 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob \add him:\add* the
wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night until the
morning.
\p
\v 14 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the
blind, but shalt fear thy God: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the
person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: \add but\add* in
righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
\p
\v 16 Thou shalt not go up and down \add as\add* a talebearer among thy
people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I 
\add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 17 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in any wise
rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.
\p
\v 18 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy
people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I \add am\add* the
LORD.
\p
\v 19 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a
diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a
garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.
\p
\v 20 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that \add is\add* a bondmaid,
betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she
shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. 
\v 21 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation, \add even\add* a ram for a trespass
offering. 
\v 22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the
trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin
which he hath done shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 23 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner
of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised:
three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of. 
\v 24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the
LORD \add withal. \add*
\v 25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may
yield unto you the increase thereof: I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 26 Ye shall not eat \add any thing\add* with the blood: neither shall ye
use enchantment, nor observe times. 
\v 27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the
corners of thy beard. 
\v 28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any
marks upon you: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the
land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
\p
\v 30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I \add am
\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards,
to be defiled by them: I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old
man, and fear thy God: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.
\v 34 \add But\add* the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as
one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers
in the land of Egypt: I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or
in measure. 
\v 36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye
have: I \add am\add* the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
Egypt. 
\v 37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do
them: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever \add he be
\add* of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel,
that giveth \add any\add* of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to
death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 
\v 3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among
his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my
sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. 
\v 4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man,
when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: 
\v 5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and
will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with
Molech, from among their people.
\p
\v 6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after
wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that
soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
\p
\v 7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I \add am\add* the
LORD your God. 
\v 8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I \add am\add* the LORD which
sanctify you.
\p
\v 9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put
to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood \add shall be
\add* upon him.
\p
\v 10 And the man that committeth adultery with \add another\add* man’s wife,
\add even he\add* that committeth adultery with his neighbour’s wife, the
adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. 
\v 11 And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered his
father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood 
\add shall be\add* upon them. 
\v 12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be
put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood \add shall be
\add* upon them. 
\v 13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them
have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood
\add shall be\add* upon them. 
\v 14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it \add is\add* wickedness:
they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness
among you. 
\v 15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye
shall slay the beast. 
\v 16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt
kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood
\add shall be\add* upon them. 
\v 17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his
mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it 
\add is\add* a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their
people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
\v 18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall
uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered
the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their
people. 
\v 19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of
thy father’s sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their
iniquity. 
\v 20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered his
uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. 
\v 21 And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it \add is\add* an unclean
thing: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.
\p
\v 22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do
them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out. 
\v 23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out
before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred
them. 
\v 24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give
it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I 
\add am\add* the LORD your God, which have separated you from \add other
\add* people. 
\v 25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and
between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable
by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the
ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. 
\v 26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD \add am\add* holy, and have
severed you from \add other\add* people, that ye should be mine.
\p
\v 27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard,
shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood 
\add shall be\add* upon them.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons of Aaron,
and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for the dead among his people:
\v 2 But for his kin, that is near unto him, \add that is,\add* for his
mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his
brother, 
\v 3 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath had no
husband; for her may he be defiled. 
\v 4 \add But\add* he shall not defile himself, \add being\add* a chief man
among his people, to profane himself. 
\v 5 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave
off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh. 
\v 6 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of their God:
for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, \add and\add* the bread of their
God, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy. 
\v 7 They shall not take a wife \add that is\add* a whore, or profane; neither
shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he \add is\add* holy
unto his God. 
\v 8 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy God:
he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which sanctify you, \add am
\add* holy.
\p
\v 9 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the
whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire. 
\v 10 And \add he that is\add* the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to put on the
garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his clothes; 
\v 11 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his
father, or for his mother; 
\v 12 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of
his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of his God \add is\add* upon him:
I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 13 And he shall take a wife in her virginity. 
\v 14 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, \add or\add* an harlot, these
shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife. 
\v 15 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the LORD do
sanctify him.
\p
\v 16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 17 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever \add he be\add* of thy seed in their
generations that hath \add any\add* blemish, let him not approach to offer the
bread of his God. 
\v 18 For whatsoever man \add he be\add* that hath a blemish, he shall not
approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or any thing
superfluous, 
\v 19 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded, 
\v 20 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or be
scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 
\v 21 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest shall come
nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by fire: he hath a blemish; he
shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his God. 
\v 22 He shall eat the bread of his God, \add both\add* of the most holy, and
of the holy. 
\v 23 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the altar,
because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I the LORD
do sanctify them. 
\v 24 And Moses told \add it\add* unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all
the children of Israel.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the
holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name
\add in those things\add* which they hallow unto me: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\v 3 Say unto them, Whosoever \add he be\add* of all your seed among your
generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel
hallow unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut
off from my presence: I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 4 What man soever of the seed of Aaron \add is\add* a leper, or hath a
running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And
whoso toucheth any thing \add that is\add* unclean \add by\add* the dead, or a
man whose seed goeth from him; 
\v 5 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean,
or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 
\v 6 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until even, and
shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water. 
\v 7 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of
the holy things; because it \add is\add* his food. 
\v 8 That which dieth of itself, or is torn \add with beasts,\add* he shall
not eat to defile himself therewith: I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 9 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and
die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them. 
\v 10 There shall no stranger eat \add of\add* the holy thing: a sojourner of
the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat \add of\add* the holy thing. 
\v 11 But if the priest buy \add any\add* soul with his money, he shall eat of
it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat. 
\v 12 If the priest’s daughter also be \add married\add* unto a stranger, she
may not eat of an offering of the holy things. 
\v 13 But if the priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child,
and is returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her
father’s meat: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
\p
\v 14 And if a man eat \add of\add* the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
put the fifth \add part\add* thereof unto it, and shall give \add it
\add* unto the priest with the holy thing. 
\v 15 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel,
which they offer unto the LORD; 
\v 16 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their
holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.
\p
\v 17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 18 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel,
and say unto them, Whatsoever \add he be\add* of the house of Israel, or of
the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and
for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a
burnt offering; 
\v 19 \add Ye shall offer\add* at your own will a male without blemish, of the
beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats. 
\v 20 \add But\add* whatsoever hath a blemish, \add that\add* shall ye not
offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you. 
\v 21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to
accomplish \add his\add* vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it
shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein. 
\v 22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye
shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon
the altar unto the LORD. 
\v 23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in
his parts, that mayest thou offer \add for\add* a freewill offering; but for a
vow it shall not be accepted. 
\v 24 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or
broken, or cut; neither shall ye make \add any offering thereof\add* in your
land. 
\v 25 Neither from a stranger’s hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of
any of these; because their corruption \add is\add* in them, \add and
\add* blemishes \add be\add* in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
\p
\v 26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 27 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall
be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall
be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
\v 28 And \add whether it be\add* cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
young both in one day. 
\v 29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer
\add it\add* at your own will. 
\v 30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until
the morrow: I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I \add am
\add* the LORD. 
\v 32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the
children of Israel: I \add am\add* the LORD which hallow you, 
\v 33 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I \add am
\add* the LORD.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, \add Concerning
\add* the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim \add to be\add* holy
convocations, \add even\add* these \add are\add* my feasts. 
\v 3 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day \add is\add* the sabbath
of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work \add therein:\add* it 
\add is\add* the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.
\p
\v 4 These \add are\add* the feasts of the LORD, \add even\add* holy
convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons. 
\v 5 In the fourteenth \add day\add* of the first month at even \add is
\add* the LORD’S passover. 
\v 6 And on the fifteenth day of the same month \add is\add* the feast of
unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. 
\v 7 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no
servile work therein. 
\v 8 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in
the seventh day \add is\add* an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work
\add therein.\add*
\p
\v 9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come
into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then
ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest: 
\v 11 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on
the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it. 
\v 12 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb without
blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the LORD. 
\v 13 And the meat offering thereof \add shall be\add* two tenth deals of fine
flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD \add for
\add* a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof \add shall be\add* of
wine, the fourth \add part\add* of an hin. 
\v 14 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green ears, until
the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: \add it shall
be\add* a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
\p
\v 15 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the
day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be
complete: 
\v 16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty
days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD. 
\v 17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth
deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; 
\add they are\add* the firstfruits unto the LORD. 
\v 18 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the
first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be \add for
\add* a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and their
drink offerings, \add even\add* an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto
the LORD. 
\v 19 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two
lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings. 
\v 20 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits 
\add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they shall
be holy to the LORD for the priest. 
\v 21 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, \add that\add* it may be an
holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work \add therein: it shall
be\add* a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
\p
\v 22 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean
riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou
gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and
to the stranger: I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 24 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, in the
first \add day\add* of the month, shall ye have a sabbath, a memorial of
blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation. 
\v 25 Ye shall do no servile work \add therein:\add* but ye shall offer an
offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\p
\v 26 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 27 Also on the tenth \add day\add* of this seventh month \add there shall
be\add* a day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye
shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
\v 28 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it \add is\add* a day of
atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your God. 
\v 29 For whatsoever soul \add it be\add* that shall not be afflicted in that
same day, he shall be cut off from among his people. 
\v 30 And whatsoever soul \add it be\add* that doeth any work in that same
day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people. 
\v 31 Ye shall do no manner of work: \add it shall be\add* a statute for ever
throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
\v 32 It \add shall be\add* unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
your souls: in the ninth \add day\add* of the month at even, from even unto
even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.
\p
\v 33 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 34 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this
seventh month \add shall be\add* the feast of tabernacles \add for\add* seven
days unto the LORD. 
\v 35 On the first day \add shall be\add* an holy convocation: ye shall do no
servile work \add therein. \add*
\v 36 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: on the
eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an
offering made by fire unto the LORD: it \add is\add* a solemn assembly; 
\add and\add* ye shall do no servile work \add therein. \add*
\v 37 These \add are\add* the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim 
\add to be\add* holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto the
LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings,
every thing upon his day: 
\v 38 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all
your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings, which ye give unto the
LORD. 
\v 39 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in
the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the LORD seven days: on the
first day \add shall be\add* a sabbath, and on the eighth day \add shall be
\add* a sabbath. 
\v 40 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees,
branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the
brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days. 
\v 41 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year. 
\add It shall be\add* a statute for ever in your generations: ye shall
celebrate it in the seventh month. 
\v 42 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites born shall
dwell in booths: 
\v 43 That your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to
dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I \add am
\add* the LORD your God. 
\v 44 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the LORD.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive
beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually. 
\v 3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation,
shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD
continually: \add it shall be\add* a statute for ever in your generations. 
\v 4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD
continually.
\p
\v 5 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth
deals shall be in one cake. 
\v 6 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table
before the LORD. 
\v 7 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon \add each\add* row, that it may
be on the bread for a memorial, \add even\add* an offering made by fire unto
the LORD. 
\v 8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, 
\add being taken\add* from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
\v 9 And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in the holy
place: for it \add is\add* most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD
made by fire by a perpetual statute.
\p
\v 10 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father \add was\add* an
Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the
Israelitish \add woman\add* and a man of Israel strove together in the camp; 
\v 11 And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name \add of the LORD,
\add* and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother’s name 
\add was\add* Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:) 
\v 12 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be shewed
them. 
\v 13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 14 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that
heard \add him\add* lay their hands upon his head, and let all the
congregation stone him. 
\v 15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever
curseth his God shall bear his sin. 
\v 16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to
death, \add and\add* all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well
the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name 
\add of the LORD,\add* shall be put to death.
\p
\v 17 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death. 
\v 18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast. 
\v 19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall
it be done to him; 
\v 20 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a
blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him \add again. \add*
\v 21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a
man, he shall be put to death. 
\v 22 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of
your own country: for I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 23 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth
him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the
children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into
the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD. 
\v 3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy
vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof; 
\v 4 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a
sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy
vineyard. 
\v 5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap,
neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: \add for\add* it is a year of
rest unto the land. 
\v 6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and for thy
servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger
that sojourneth with thee, 
\v 7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that \add are\add* in thy land,
shall all the increase thereof be meat.
\p
\v 8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times
seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee
forty and nine years. 
\v 9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth 
\add day\add* of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the
trumpet sound throughout all your land. 
\v 10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout 
\add all\add* the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile
unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall
return every man unto his family. 
\v 11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither
reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather \add the grapes
\add* in it of thy vine undressed. 
\v 12 For it \add is\add* the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
the increase thereof out of the field. 
\v 13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
possession. 
\v 14 And if thou sell \add ought\add* unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not oppress one another: 
\v 15 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy
neighbour, \add and\add* according unto the number of years of the fruits he
shall sell unto thee: 
\v 16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price
thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price
of it: for \add according\add* to the number \add of the years\add* of the
fruits doth he sell unto thee. 
\v 17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God:
for I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;
and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. 
\v 19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and
dwell therein in safety. 
\v 20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we
shall not sow, nor gather in our increase: 
\v 21 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall
bring forth fruit for three years. 
\v 22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat \add yet\add* of old fruit
until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat \add of
\add* the old \add store.\add*
\p
\v 23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land \add is\add* mine; for
ye \add are\add* strangers and sojourners with me. 
\v 24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for
the land.
\p
\v 25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away \add some\add* of his
possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that
which his brother sold. 
\v 26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem
it; 
\v 27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the
overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his
possession. 
\v 28 But if he be not able to restore \add it\add* to him, then that which is
sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of
jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto his
possession. 
\v 29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem
it within a whole year after it is sold; \add within\add* a full year may he
redeem it. 
\v 30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the
house that \add is\add* in the walled city shall be established for ever to
him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the
jubile. 
\v 31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall
be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall
go out in the jubile. 
\v 32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, \add and\add* the houses of
the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time. 
\v 33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was sold, and
the city of his possession, shall go out in \add the year of\add* jubile: for
the houses of the cities of the Levites \add are\add* their possession among
the children of Israel. 
\v 34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is
their perpetual possession.
\p
\v 35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then
thou shalt relieve him: \add yea, though he be\add* a stranger, or a
sojourner; that he may live with thee. 
\v 36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy
brother may live with thee. 
\v 37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals
for increase. 
\v 38 I \add am\add* the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, \add and\add* to be your God.
\p
\v 39 And if thy brother \add that dwelleth\add* by thee be waxen poor, and be
sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant: 
\v 40 \add But\add* as an hired servant, \add and\add* as a sojourner, he
shall be with thee, \add and\add* shall serve thee unto the year of jubile: 
\v 41 And \add then\add* shall he depart from thee, \add both\add* he and his
children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
possession of his fathers shall he return. 
\v 42 For they \add are\add* my servants, which I brought forth out of the
land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen. 
\v 43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God. 
\v 44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, \add shall
be\add* of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen
and bondmaids. 
\v 45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of
them shall ye buy, and of their families that \add are\add* with you, which
they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession. 
\v 46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to
inherit \add them for\add* a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever:
but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over
another with rigour.
\p
\v 47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother 
\add that dwelleth\add* by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger 
\add or\add* sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family: 
\v 48 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may
redeem him: 
\v 49 Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or \add any
\add* that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be
able, he may redeem himself. 
\v 50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was
sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale shall be
according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant
shall it be with him. 
\v 51 If \add there be\add* yet many years \add behind,\add* according unto
them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he
was bought for. 
\v 52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then he shall
count with him, \add and\add* according unto his years shall he give him again
the price of his redemption. 
\v 53 \add And\add* as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: 
\add and the other\add* shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight. 
\v 54 And if he be not redeemed in these \add years,\add* then he shall go out
in the year of jubile, \add both\add* he, and his children with him. 
\v 55 For unto me the children of Israel \add are\add* servants; they 
\add are\add* my servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I 
\add am\add* the LORD your God.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up a
standing image, neither shall ye set up \add any\add* image of stone in your
land, to bow down unto it: for I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I \add am
\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do them; 
\v 4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her
increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. 
\v 5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall
reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell
in your land safely. 
\v 6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall
make \add you\add* afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither
shall the sword go through your land. 
\v 7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the
sword. 
\v 8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you shall put
ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword. 
\v 9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply
you, and establish my covenant with you. 
\v 10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of the new.
\v 11 And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
you. 
\v 12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my
people. 
\v 13 I \add am\add* the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the
bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.
\p
\v 14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
commandments; 
\v 15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my judgments,
so that ye will not do all my commandments, \add but\add* that ye break my
covenant: 
\v 16 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror,
consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause
sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall
eat it. 
\v 17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your
enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none
pursueth you. 
\v 18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish
you seven times more for your sins. 
\v 19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as
iron, and your earth as brass: 
\v 20 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield
her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
\p
\v 21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will
bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins. 
\v 22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your
children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your 
\add high\add* ways shall be desolate. 
\v 23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk
contrary unto me; 
\v 24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven
times for your sins. 
\v 25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of 
\add my\add* covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I
will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of
the enemy. 
\v 26 \add And\add* when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women
shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver \add you\add* your
bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied. 
\v 27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk contrary unto
me; 
\v 28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I, will
chastise you seven times for your sins. 
\v 29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters
shall ye eat. 
\v 30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images, and cast
your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you. 
\v 31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries unto
desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours. 
\v 32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwell
therein shall be astonished at it. 
\v 33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword
after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste. 
\v 34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate,
and ye be in your enemies’ land; \add even\add* then shall the land rest, and
enjoy her sabbaths. 
\v 35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in
your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it. 
\v 36 And upon them that are left \add alive\add* of you I will send a
faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a
shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword;
and they shall fall when none pursueth. 
\v 37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when
none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies. 
\v 38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your enemies
shall eat you up. 
\v 39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your
enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine
away with them. 
\v 40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers,
with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have
walked contrary unto me; 
\v 41 And \add that\add* I also have walked contrary unto them, and have
brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised
hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: 
\v 42 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with
Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember
the land. 
\v 43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while
she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of
their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because
their soul abhorred my statutes. 
\v 44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will
not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to
break my covenant with them: for I \add am\add* the LORD their God. 
\v 45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors,
whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen,
that I might be their God: I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 46 These \add are\add* the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of
Moses.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall
make a singular vow, the persons \add shall be\add* for the LORD by thy
estimation. 
\v 3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto
sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after
the shekel of the sanctuary. 
\v 4 And if it \add be\add* a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
shekels. 
\v 5 And if \add it be\add* from five years old even unto twenty years old,
then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female
ten shekels. 
\v 6 And if \add it be\add* from a month old even unto five years old, then
thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female
thy estimation \add shall be\add* three shekels of silver. 
\v 7 And if \add it be\add* from sixty years old and above; if \add it be
\add* a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female
ten shekels. 
\v 8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself
before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability
that vowed shall the priest value him. 
\v 9 And if \add it be\add* a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
LORD, all that \add any man\add* giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy. 
\v 10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a
good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange
thereof shall be holy. 
\v 11 And if \add it be\add* any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest: 
\v 12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou
valuest it, \add who art\add* the priest, so shall it be. 
\v 13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth \add part
\add* thereof unto thy estimation.
\p
\v 14 And when a man shall sanctify his house \add to be\add* holy unto the
LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the
priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand. 
\v 15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add
the fifth \add part\add* of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall
be his. 
\v 16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD \add some part\add* of a field
of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof:
an homer of barley seed \add shall be valued\add* at fifty shekels of silver.
\v 17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy
estimation it shall stand. 
\v 18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall
reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the
year of the jubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation. 
\v 19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he
shall add the fifth \add part\add* of the money of thy estimation unto it, and
it shall be assured to him. 
\v 20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to
another man, it shall not be redeemed any more. 
\v 21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the
LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s. 
\v 22 And if \add a man\add* sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
bought, which \add is\add* not of the fields of his possession; 
\v 23 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, 
\add even\add* unto the year of the jubile: and he shall give thine estimation
in that day, \add as\add* a holy thing unto the LORD. 
\v 24 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was
bought, \add even\add* to him to whom the possession of the land \add did
belong. \add*
\v 25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the
sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
\p
\v 26 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’S firstling,
no man shall sanctify it; whether \add it be\add* ox, or sheep: it \add is
\add* the LORD’S. 
\v 27 And if \add it be\add* of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth \add part\add* of it
thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy
estimation. 
\v 28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD
of all that he hath, \add both\add* of man and beast, and of the field of his
possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing \add is\add* most
holy unto the LORD. 
\v 29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; 
\add but\add* shall surely be put to death. 
\v 30 And all the tithe of the land, \add whether\add* of the seed of the
land, \add or\add* of the fruit of the tree, \add is\add* the LORD’S: 
\add it is\add* holy unto the LORD. 
\v 31 And if a man will at all redeem \add ought\add* of his tithes, he shall
add thereto the fifth \add part\add* thereof. 
\v 32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, \add even
\add* of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the
LORD. 
\v 33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change
it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be
holy; it shall not be redeemed. 
\v 34 These \add are\add* the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for
the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
