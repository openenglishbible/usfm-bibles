\mt The Gospel According to St. Luke 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration
of those things which are most surely believed among us, 
\v 2 Even as they delivered them unto us, which from the beginning were
eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word; 
\v 3 It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things
from the very first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus, 
\v 4 That thou mightest know the certainty of those things, wherein thou hast
been instructed.
\p
\v 5 There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest
named Zacharias, of the course of Abia: and his wife \add was\add* of the
daughters of Aaron, and her name \add was\add* Elisabeth. 
\v 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments
and ordinances of the Lord blameless. 
\v 7 And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both
were \add now\add* well stricken in years. 
\v 8 And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before
God in the order of his course, 
\v 9 According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn
incense when he went into the temple of the Lord. 
\v 10 And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time
of incense. 
\v 11 And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right
side of the altar of incense. 
\v 12 And when Zacharias saw \add him,\add* he was troubled, and fear fell
upon him. 
\v 13 But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is
heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his
name John. 
\v 14 And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his
birth. 
\v 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither
wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from
his mother’s womb. 
\v 16 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.
\v 17 And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the
hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of
the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. 
\v 18 And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am
an old man, and my wife well stricken in years. 
\v 19 And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, that stand in the
presence of God; and am sent to speak unto thee, and to shew thee these glad
tidings. 
\v 20 And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day
that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words,
which shall be fulfilled in their season. 
\v 21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so
long in the temple. 
\v 22 And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived
that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he beckoned unto them, and
remained speechless. 
\v 23 And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were
accomplished, he departed to his own house. 
\v 24 And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five
months, saying, 
\v 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on 
\add me,\add* to take away my reproach among men. 
\v 26 And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city
of Galilee, named Nazareth, 
\v 27 To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of
David; and the virgin’s name \add was\add* Mary. 
\v 28 And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, \add thou that art
\add* highly favoured, the Lord \add is\add* with thee: blessed \add art
\add* thou among women. 
\v 29 And when she saw \add him,\add* she was troubled at his saying, and cast
in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. 
\v 30 And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour
with God. 
\v 31 And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and
shalt call his name JESUS. 
\v 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the
Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: 
\v 33 And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom
there shall be no end. 
\v 34 Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a
man? 
\v 35 And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon
thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that
holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. 
\v 36 And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her
old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren. 
\v 37 For with God nothing shall be impossible. 
\v 38 And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according
to thy word. And the angel departed from her. 
\v 39 And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste,
into a city of Juda; 
\v 40 And entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elisabeth. 
\v 41 And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary,
the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: 
\v 42 And she spake out with a loud voice, and said, Blessed \add art
\add* thou among women, and blessed \add is\add* the fruit of thy womb. 
\v 43 And whence \add is\add* this to me, that the mother of my Lord should
come to me? 
\v 44 For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears,
the babe leaped in my womb for joy. 
\v 45 And blessed \add is\add* she that believed: for there shall be a
performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. 
\v 46 And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord, 
\v 47 And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour. 
\v 48 For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from
henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. 
\v 49 For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy \add is
\add* his name. 
\v 50 And his mercy \add is\add* on them that fear him from generation to
generation. 
\v 51 He hath shewed strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the
imagination of their hearts. 
\v 52 He hath put down the mighty from \add their\add* seats, and exalted them
of low degree. 
\v 53 He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent
empty away. 
\v 54 He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of \add his
\add* mercy; 
\v 55 As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever. 
\v 56 And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own
house. 
\v 57 Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she
brought forth a son. 
\v 58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great
mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her. 
\v 59 And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the
child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father. 
\v 60 And his mother answered and said, Not \add so;\add* but he shall be
called John. 
\v 61 And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by
this name. 
\v 62 And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called. 
\v 63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is John.
And they marvelled all. 
\v 64 And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue \add loosed,
\add* and he spake, and praised God. 
\v 65 And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings
were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. 
\v 66 And all they that heard \add them\add* laid \add them\add* up in their
hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord
was with him. 
\v 67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied,
saying, 
\v 68 Blessed \add be\add* the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and
redeemed his people, 
\v 69 And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his
servant David; 
\v 70 As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the
world began: 
\v 71 That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that
hate us; 
\v 72 To perform the mercy \add promised\add* to our fathers, and to remember
his holy covenant; 
\v 73 The oath which he sware to our father Abraham, 
\v 74 That he would grant unto us, that we being delivered out of the hand of
our enemies might serve him without fear, 
\v 75 In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life. 
\v 76 And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou
shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways; 
\v 77 To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their
sins, 
\v 78 Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high
hath visited us, 
\v 79 To give light to them that sit in darkness and \add in\add* the shadow
of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace. 
\v 80 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts
till the day of his shewing unto Israel.

\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from
Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. 
\v 2 (\add And\add* this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of
Syria.) 
\v 3 And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. 
\v 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into
Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of
the house and lineage of David:) 
\v 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. 
\v 6 And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
that she should be delivered. 
\v 7 And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling
clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the
inn. 
\v 8 And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flock by night. 
\v 9 And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord
shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. 
\v 10 And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good
tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. 
\v 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is
Christ the Lord. 
\v 12 And this \add shall be\add* a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe
wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. 
\v 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
praising God, and saying, 
\v 14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. 
\v 15 And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven,
the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see
this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. 
\v 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying
in a manger. 
\v 17 And when they had seen \add it,\add* they made known abroad the saying
which was told them concerning this child. 
\v 18 And all they that heard \add it\add* wondered at those things which were
told them by the shepherds. 
\v 19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered \add them\add* in her
heart. 
\v 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the
things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. 
\v 21 And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child,
his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was
conceived in the womb. 
\v 22 And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were
accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present \add him\add* to the
Lord; 
\v 23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the
womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) 
\v 24 And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of
the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. 
\v 25 And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name \add was
\add* Simeon; and the same man \add was\add* just and devout, waiting for the
consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. 
\v 26 And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see
death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. 
\v 27 And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought
in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, 
\v 28 Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, 
\v 29 Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy
word: 
\v 30 For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, 
\v 31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; 
\v 32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. 
\v 33 And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of
him. 
\v 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this 
\add child\add* is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and
for a sign which shall be spoken against; 
\v 35 (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts
of many hearts may be revealed. 
\v 36 And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the
tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven
years from her virginity; 
\v 37 And she \add was\add* a widow of about fourscore and four years, which
departed not from the temple, but served \add God\add* with fastings and
prayers night and day. 
\v 38 And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and
spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. 
\v 39 And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord,
they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. 
\v 40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and
the grace of God was upon him. 
\v 41 Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
passover. 
\v 42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the
custom of the feast. 
\v 43 And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus
tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not \add of it. 
\add*
\v 44 But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s
journey; and they sought him among \add their\add* kinsfolk and acquaintance.
\v 45 And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem,
seeking him. 
\v 46 And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple,
sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them
questions. 
\v 47 And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and
answers. 
\v 48 And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him,
Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought
thee sorrowing. 
\v 49 And he said unto them, \wj How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that
I must be about my Father’s business? \wj*
\v 50 And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. 
\v 51 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto
them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. 
\v 52 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and
man.

\p
\v 1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate
being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother
Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the
tetrarch of Abilene, 
\v 2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John
the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. 
\v 3 And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of
repentance for the remission of sins; 
\v 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying,
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord,
make his paths straight. 
\v 5 Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be
brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways 
\add shall be\add* made smooth; 
\v 6 And all flesh shall see the salvation of God. 
\v 7 Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O
generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
\v 8 Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say
within yourselves, We have Abraham to \add our\add* father: for I say unto
you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 
\v 9 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: every tree
therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the
fire. 
\v 10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then? 
\v 11 He answereth and saith unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart
to him that hath none; and he that hath meat, let him do likewise. 
\v 12 Then came also publicans to be baptized, and said unto him, Master, what
shall we do? 
\v 13 And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you. 
\v 14 And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do?
And he said unto them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse \add any
\add* falsely; and be content with your wages. 
\v 15 And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts
of John, whether he were the Christ, or not; 
\v 16 John answered, saying unto \add them\add* all, I indeed baptize you with
water; but one mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose shoes I am not
worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire: 
\v 17 Whose fan \add is\add* in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
floor, and will gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn
with fire unquenchable. 
\v 18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people. 
\v 19 But Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother
Philip’s wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done, 
\v 20 Added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison. 
\v 21 Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also
being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, 
\v 22 And the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and
a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am
well pleased. 
\v 23 And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was
supposed) the son of Joseph, which was \add the son\add* of Heli, 
\v 24 Which was \add the son\add* of Matthat, which was \add the son
\add* of Levi, which was \add the son\add* of Melchi, which was \add the son

\v 1 And Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led
by the Spirit into the wilderness, 
\v 2 Being forty days tempted of the devil. And in those days he did eat
nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. 
\v 3 And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this
stone that it be made bread. 
\v 4 And Jesus answered him, saying, \wj It is written, That man shall not
live by bread alone, but by every word of God. \wj*
\v 5 And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all
the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. 
\v 6 And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the
glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give
it. 
\v 7 If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. 
\v 8 And Jesus answered and said unto him, \wj Get thee behind me, Satan: for
it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
serve. \wj*
\v 9 And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple,
and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: 
\v 10 For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep
thee: 
\v 11 And in \add their\add* hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time
thou dash thy foot against a stone. 
\v 12 And Jesus answering said unto him, \wj It is said, Thou shalt not tempt
the Lord thy God. \wj*
\v 13 And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him
for a season.
\p
\v 14 And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there
went out a fame of him through all the region round about. 
\v 15 And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
\p
\v 16 And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his
custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to
read. 
\v 17 And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And
when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, 
\v 18 \wj The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to
preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to
preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to
set at liberty them that are bruised, \wj*
\v 19 \wj To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. \wj*
\v 20 And he closed the book, and he gave \add it\add* again to the minister,
and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were
fastened on him. 
\v 21 And he began to say unto them, \wj This day is this scripture fulfilled
in your ears. \wj*
\v 22 And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which
proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son? 
\v 23 And he said unto them, \wj Ye will surely say unto me this proverb,
Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also
here in thy country. \wj*
\v 24 And he said, \wj Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his
own country. \wj*
\v 25 \wj But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of
Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great
famine was throughout all the land; \wj*
\v 26 \wj But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, \add a
city\add*\wj*\wj  of Sidon, unto a woman \add that was\add*\wj*\wj  a widow. 
\wj*
\v 27 \wj And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet;
and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian. \wj*
\v 28 And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled
with wrath, 
\v 29 And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow
of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down
headlong. 
\v 30 But he passing through the midst of them went his way, 
\v 31 And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the
sabbath days. 
\v 32 And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power.
\p
\v 33 And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean
devil, and cried out with a loud voice, 
\v 34 Saying, Let \add us\add* alone; what have we to do with thee, 
\add thou\add* Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who
thou art; the Holy One of God. 
\v 35 And Jesus rebuked him, saying, \wj Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
\wj* And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and
hurt him not. 
\v 36 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a
word \add is\add* this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean
spirits, and they come out. 
\v 37 And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round
about.
\p
\v 38 And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. And
Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for
her. 
\v 39 And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and
immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
\p
\v 40 Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers
diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them,
and healed them. 
\v 41 And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art
Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking \add them\add* suffered them not to
speak: for they knew that he was Christ. 
\v 42 And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the
people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not
depart from them. 
\v 43 And he said unto them, \wj I must preach the kingdom of God to other
cities also: for therefore am I sent. \wj*
\v 44 And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the
word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret, 
\v 2 And saw two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out
of them, and were washing \add their\add* nets. 
\v 3 And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him
that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down, and taught
the people out of the ship. 
\v 4 Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, \wj Launch out into
the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. \wj*
\v 5 And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night,
and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. 
\v 6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes:
and their net brake. 
\v 7 And they beckoned unto \add their\add* partners, which were in the other
ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the
ships, so that they began to sink. 
\v 8 When Simon Peter saw \add it,\add* he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying,
Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. 
\v 9 For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the
fishes which they had taken: 
\v 10 And so \add was\add* also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which
were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, \wj Fear not; from
henceforth thou shalt catch men. \wj*
\v 11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and
followed him.
\p
\v 12 And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of
leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on \add his\add* face, and besought him,
saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 
\v 13 And he put forth \add his\add* hand, and touched him, saying, \wj I
will: be thou clean.\wj* And immediately the leprosy departed from him. 
\v 14 And he charged him to tell no man: \wj but go, and shew thyself to the
priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a
testimony unto them. \wj*
\v 15 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great
multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their
infirmities.
\p
\v 16 And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed. 
\v 17 And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there
were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every
town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was 
\add present\add* to heal them.
\p
\v 18 And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy:
and they sought \add means\add* to bring him in, and to lay \add him
\add* before him. 
\v 19 And when they could not find by what \add way\add* they might bring him
in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down
through the tiling with \add his\add* couch into the midst before Jesus. 
\v 20 And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, \wj Man, thy sins are
forgiven thee. \wj*
\v 21 And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this
which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? 
\v 22 But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, 
\wj What reason ye in your hearts? \wj*
\v 23 \wj Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say,
Rise up and walk? \wj*
\v 24 \wj But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to
forgive sins,\wj* (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) \wj I say unto thee,
Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. \wj*
\v 25 And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay,
and departed to his own house, glorifying God. 
\v 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with
fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day.
\p
\v 27 And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi,
sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, \wj Follow me. 
\wj*
\v 28 And he left all, rose up, and followed him. 
\v 29 And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great
company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. 
\v 30 But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying,
Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? 
\v 31 And Jesus answering said unto them, \wj They that are whole need not a
physician; but they that are sick. \wj*
\v 32 \wj I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 33 \wj And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and
make prayers, and likewise \add the disciples\add*\wj*\wj  of the Pharisees;
but thine eat and drink? \wj*
\v 34 \wj And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber
fast, while the bridegroom is with them? \wj*
\v 35 \wj But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from
them, and then shall they fast in those days.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 36 \wj And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a
new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and
the piece that was \add taken\add*\wj*\wj  out of the new agreeth not with the
old. \wj*
\v 37 \wj And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will
burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. \wj*
\v 38 \wj But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. 
\wj*
\v 39 \wj No man also having drunk old \add wine\add*\wj*\wj  straightway
desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 6
\p
\v 1 \wj And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he
went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and
did eat, rubbing \add them\add*\wj*\wj  in \add their\add*\wj*\wj  hands. 
\wj*
\v 2 \wj And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is
not lawful to do on the sabbath days? \wj*
\v 3 \wj And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what
David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him; 
\wj*
\v 4 \wj How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the
shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to
eat but for the priests alone? \wj*
\v 5 And he said unto them, \wj That the Son of man is Lord also of the
sabbath. \wj*
\v 6 And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the
synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered. 
\v 7 And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the
sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. 
\v 8 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered
hand, \wj Rise up, and stand forth in the midst.\wj* And he arose and stood
forth. 
\v 9 Then said Jesus unto them, \wj I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on
the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy 
\add it? \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 10 \wj And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch
forth thy hand.\wj* And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the
other. 
\v 11 And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what
they might do to Jesus. 
\v 12 And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to
pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
\p
\v 13 And when it was day, he called \add unto him\add* his disciples: and of
them he chose twelve, whom also he named apostles; 
\v 14 Simon, (whom he also named Peter,) and Andrew his brother, James and
John, Philip and Bartholomew, 
\v 15 Matthew and Thomas, James the \add son\add* of Alphaeus, and Simon
called Zelotes, 
\v 16 And Judas \add the brother\add* of James, and Judas Iscariot, which also
was the traitor.
\p
\v 17 And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of
his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and
Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him,
and to be healed of their diseases; 
\v 18 And they that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed. 
\v 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out
of him, and healed \add them\add* all.
\p
\v 20 And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, \wj Blessed 
\add be ye\add*\wj*\wj  poor: for yours is the kingdom of God. \wj*
\v 21 \wj Blessed \add are ye\add*\wj*\wj  that hunger now: for ye shall be
filled. Blessed \add are ye\add*\wj*\wj  that weep now: for ye shall laugh. 
\wj*
\v 22 \wj Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall
separate you \add from their company,\add*\wj*\wj  and shall reproach 
\add you,\add*\wj*\wj  and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man’s
sake. \wj*
\v 23 \wj Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward 
\add is\add*\wj*\wj  great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers
unto the prophets. \wj*
\v 24 \wj But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your
consolation. \wj*
\v 25 \wj Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that
laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep. \wj*
\v 26 \wj Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their
fathers to the false prophets.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 27 \wj But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them
which hate you, \wj*
\v 28 \wj Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use
you. \wj*
\v 29 \wj And unto him that smiteth thee on the \add one\add*\wj*\wj  cheek
offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloke forbid not 
\add to take thy\add*\wj*\wj  coat also. \wj*
\v 30 \wj Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away
thy goods ask \add them\add*\wj*\wj  not again. \wj*
\v 31 \wj And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them
likewise. \wj*
\v 32 \wj For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners
also love those that love them. \wj*
\v 33 \wj And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye?
for sinners also do even the same. \wj*
\v 34 \wj And if ye lend \add to them\add*\wj*\wj  of whom ye hope to receive,
what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much
again. \wj*
\v 35 \wj But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing
again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the
Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and \add to\add*\wj*\wj  the evil.
\wj*
\v 36 \wj Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful. 
\wj*
\v 37 \wj Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not
be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven: \wj*
\v 38 \wj Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down,
and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For
with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again. 
\wj*
\v 39 \wj And he spake a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind?
shall they not both fall into the ditch? \wj*
\v 40 \wj The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect
shall be as his master. \wj*
\v 41 \wj And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but
perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye? \wj*
\v 42 \wj Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out
the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that
is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own
eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy
brother’s eye. \wj*
\v 43 \wj For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a
corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. \wj*
\v 44 \wj For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not
gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. \wj*
\v 45 \wj A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that
which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth
forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth
speaketh.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 46 \wj And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 
\wj*
\v 47 \wj Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I
will shew you to whom he is like: \wj*
\v 48 \wj He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the
foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently
upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock. 
\wj*
\v 49 \wj But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a
foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat
vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 7
\p
\v 1 \wj Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people,
he entered into Capernaum. \wj*
\v 2 \wj And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick,
and ready to die. \wj*
\v 3 \wj And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews,
beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. \wj*
\v 4 \wj And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying,
That he was worthy for whom he should do this: \wj*
\v 5 \wj For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. 
\wj*
\v 6 \wj Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the
house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not
thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: 
\wj*
\v 7 \wj Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say
in a word, and my servant shall be healed. \wj*
\v 8 \wj For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers,
and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and
to my servant, Do this, and he doeth \add it. \add*\wj*
\v 9 \wj When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him
about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not
found so great faith, no, not in Israel. \wj*
\v 10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole
that had been sick.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain;
and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. 
\v 12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead
man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much
people of the city was with her. 
\v 13 And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her,
\wj Weep not. \wj*
\v 14 And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare \add him
\add* stood still. And he said, \wj Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. 
\wj*
\v 15 And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to
his mother. 
\v 16 And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a
great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. 
\v 17 And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout
all the region round about. 
\v 18 And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.
\p
\v 19 And John calling \add unto him\add* two of his disciples sent 
\add them\add* to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for
another? 
\v 20 When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us
unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? 
\v 21 And in that same hour he cured many of \add their\add* infirmities and
plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many \add that were\add* blind he gave
sight. 
\v 22 Then Jesus answering said unto them, \wj Go your way, and tell John what
things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the
lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the
gospel is preached. \wj*
\v 23 \wj And blessed is \add he,\add*\wj*\wj  whosoever shall not be offended
in me.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 24 \wj And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak
unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to
see? A reed shaken with the wind? \wj*
\v 25 \wj But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in
kings courts. \wj*
\v 26 \wj But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and
much more than a prophet. \wj*
\v 27 \wj This is \add he,\add*\wj*\wj  of whom it is written, Behold, I send
my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. 
\wj*
\v 28 \wj For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not
a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom
of God is greater than he. \wj*
\v 29 And all the people that heard \add him,\add* and the publicans,
justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. 
\v 30 But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against
themselves, being not baptized of him.
\p
\v 31 And the Lord said, \wj Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this
generation? and to what are they like? \wj*
\v 32 \wj They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling
one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we
have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. \wj*
\v 33 \wj For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine;
and ye say, He hath a devil. \wj*
\v 34 \wj The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a
gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 
\wj*
\v 35 \wj But wisdom is justified of all her children.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 36 \wj And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And
he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat. \wj*
\v 37 \wj And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew
that \add Jesus\add*\wj*\wj  sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an
alabaster box of ointment, \wj*
\v 38 \wj And stood at his feet behind \add him\add*\wj*\wj  weeping, and
began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe \add them\add*\wj*\wj  with
the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed \add them\add*
\wj*\wj  with the ointment. \wj*
\v 39 \wj Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw \add it,\add*
\wj*\wj  he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet,
would have known who and what manner of woman \add this is\add*\wj*\wj  that
toucheth him: for she is a sinner. \wj*
\v 40 \wj And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say
unto thee.\wj* And he saith, Master, say on. 
\v 41 \wj There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed
five hundred pence, and the other fifty. \wj*
\v 42 \wj And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell
me therefore, which of them will love him most? \wj*
\v 43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that \add he,\add* to whom he forgave
most. And he said unto him, \wj Thou hast rightly judged. \wj*
\v 44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, \wj Seest thou this
woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but
she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped \add them\add*\wj*\wj  with the
hairs of her head. \wj*
\v 45 \wj Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath
not ceased to kiss my feet. \wj*
\v 46 \wj My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed
my feet with ointment. \wj*
\v 47 \wj Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven;
for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, \add the same\add*
\wj*\wj  loveth little. \wj*
\v 48 And he said unto her, \wj Thy sins are forgiven. \wj*
\v 49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who
is this that forgiveth sins also? 
\v 50 And he said to the woman, \wj Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 8
\p
\v 1 \wj And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and
village, preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the
twelve \add were\add*\wj*\wj  with him, \wj*
\v 2 \wj And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and
infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils, \wj*
\v 3 \wj And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many
others, which ministered unto him of their substance.\wj*
\p
\v 4 \wj And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out
of every city, he spake by a parable: \wj*
\v 5 \wj A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the
way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it. 
\wj*
\v 6 \wj And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it
withered away, because it lacked moisture. \wj*
\v 7 \wj And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and
choked it. \wj*
\v 8 \wj And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an
hundredfold.\wj* And when he had said these things, he cried, \wj He that hath
ears to hear, let him hear. \wj*
\v 9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be? 
\v 10 And he said, \wj Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the
kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and
hearing they might not understand. \wj*
\v 11 \wj Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. \wj*
\v 12 \wj Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and
taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be
saved. \wj*
\v 13 \wj They on the rock \add are they,\add*\wj*\wj  which, when they hear,
receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe,
and in time of temptation fall away. \wj*
\v 14 \wj And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have
heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of 
\add this\add*\wj*\wj  life, and bring no fruit to perfection. \wj*
\v 15 \wj But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good
heart, having heard the word, keep \add it,\add*\wj*\wj  and bring forth fruit
with patience.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 16 \wj No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or
putteth \add it\add*\wj*\wj  under a bed; but setteth \add it\add*\wj*
\wj  on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light. \wj*
\v 17 \wj For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither 
\add any thing\add*\wj*\wj  hid, that shall not be known and come abroad. 
\wj*
\v 18 \wj Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be
given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he
seemeth to have.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 19 \wj Then came to him \add his\add*\wj*\wj  mother and his brethren, and
could not come at him for the press. \wj*
\v 20 \wj And it was told him \add by certain\add*\wj*\wj  which said, Thy
mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to see thee. \wj*
\v 21 \wj And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are
these which hear the word of God, and do it.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 22 \wj Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with
his disciples: and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of
the lake.\wj* And they launched forth. 
\v 23 But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind
on the lake; and they were filled \add with water,\add* and were in jeopardy.
\v 24 And they came to him, and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish.
Then he arose, and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water: and they
ceased, and there was a calm. 
\v 25 And he said unto them, \wj Where is your faith?\wj* And they being
afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he
commandeth even the winds and water, and they obey him.
\p
\v 26 And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against
Galilee. 
\v 27 And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain
man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither abode in 
\add any\add* house, but in the tombs. 
\v 28 When he saw Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a
loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, \add thou\add* Son of God
most high? I beseech thee, torment me not. 
\v 29 (For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For
oftentimes it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in
fetters; and he brake the bands, and was driven of the devil into the
wilderness.) 
\v 30 And Jesus asked him, saying, \wj What is thy name?\wj* And he said,
Legion: because many devils were entered into him. 
\v 31 And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the
deep. 
\v 32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and
they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them. And he
suffered them. 
\v 33 Then went the devils out of the man, and entered into the swine: and the
herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake, and were choked. 
\v 34 When they that fed \add them\add* saw what was done, they fled, and went
and told \add it\add* in the city and in the country. 
\v 35 Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found
the man, out of whom the devils were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus,
clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. 
\v 36 They also which saw \add it\add* told them by what means he that was
possessed of the devils was healed.
\p
\v 37 Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about
besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear: and he
went up into the ship, and returned back again. 
\v 38 Now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he
might be with him: but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
\v 39 \wj Return to thine own house, and shew how great things God hath done
unto thee.\wj* And he went his way, and published throughout the whole city
how great things Jesus had done unto him. 
\v 40 And it came to pass, that, when Jesus was returned, the people 
\add gladly\add* received him: for they were all waiting for him.
\p
\v 41 And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the
synagogue: and he fell down at Jesus’ feet, and besought him that he would
come into his house: 
\v 42 For he had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay a
dying. But as he went the people thronged him.
\p
\v 43 And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, which had spent all
her living upon physicians, neither could be healed of any, 
\v 44 Came behind \add him,\add* and touched the border of his garment: and
immediately her issue of blood stanched. 
\v 45 And Jesus said, \wj Who touched me?\wj* When all denied, Peter and they
that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press 
\add thee,\add* and sayest thou, \wj Who touched me? \wj*
\v 46 And Jesus said, \wj Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue
is gone out of me. \wj*
\v 47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and
falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what
cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately. 
\v 48 And he said unto her, \wj Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath
made thee whole; go in peace.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 49 \wj While he yet spake, there cometh one from the ruler of the
synagogue’s \add house,\add*\wj*\wj  saying to him, Thy daughter is dead;
trouble not the Master. \wj*
\v 50 \wj But when Jesus heard \add it,\add*\wj*\wj  he answered him, saying,
Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole. \wj*
\v 51 And when he came into the house, he suffered no man to go in, save
Peter, and James, and John, and the father and the mother of the maiden. 
\v 52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, \wj Weep not; she is not
dead, but sleepeth. \wj*
\v 53 And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead. 
\v 54 And he put them all out, and took her by the hand, and called, saying, 
\wj Maid, arise. \wj*
\v 55 And her spirit came again, and she arose straightway: and he commanded
to give her meat. 
\v 56 And her parents were astonished: but he charged them that they should
tell no man what was done.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then he called his twelve disciples together, and gave them power and
authority over all devils, and to cure diseases. 
\v 2 And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick. 
\v 3 And he said unto them, \wj Take nothing for \add your\add*\wj*\wj 
journey, neither staves, nor scrip, neither bread, neither money; neither have
two coats apiece. \wj*
\v 4 \wj And whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide, and thence depart. 
\wj*
\v 5 \wj And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city,
shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them. 
\wj*
\v 6 And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and
healing every where.
\p
\v 7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him: and he was
perplexed, because that it was said of some, that John was risen from the
dead; 
\v 8 And of some, that Elias had appeared; and of others, that one of the old
prophets was risen again. 
\v 9 And Herod said, John have I beheaded: but who is this, of whom I hear
such things? And he desired to see him.
\p
\v 10 And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had
done. And he took them, and went aside privately into a desert place belonging
to the city called Bethsaida. 
\v 11 And the people, when they knew \add it,\add* followed him: and he
received them, and spake unto them of the kingdom of God, and healed them that
had need of healing. 
\v 12 And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve, and said unto
him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the towns and country
round about, and lodge, and get victuals: for we are here in a desert place. 
\v 13 But he said unto them, \wj Give ye them to eat.\wj* And they said, We
have no more but five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy meat
for all this people. 
\v 14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, 
\wj Make them sit down by fifties in a company. \wj*
\v 15 And they did so, and made them all sit down. 
\v 16 Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to
heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and gave to the disciples to set before
the multitude. 
\v 17 And they did eat, and were all filled: and there was taken up of
fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
\p
\v 18 And it came to pass, as he was alone praying, his disciples were with
him: and he asked them, saying, \wj Whom say the people that I am? \wj*
\v 19 They answering said, John the Baptist; but some \add say,\add* Elias;
and others \add say,\add* that one of the old prophets is risen again. 
\v 20 He said unto them, \wj But whom say ye that I am?\wj* Peter answering
said, The Christ of God. 
\v 21 And he straitly charged them, and commanded \add them\add* to tell no
man that thing; 
\v 22 Saying, \wj The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of
the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be slain, and be raised the
third day.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 23 \wj And he said to \add them\add*\wj*\wj  all, If any \add man
\add*\wj*\wj  will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross
daily, and follow me. \wj*
\v 24 \wj For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will
lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. \wj*
\v 25 \wj For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose
himself, or be cast away? \wj*
\v 26 \wj For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall
the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and 
\add in his\add*\wj*\wj  Father’s, and of the holy angels. \wj*
\v 27 \wj But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall
not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 28 \wj And it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings, he took
Peter and John and James, and went up into a mountain to pray. \wj*
\v 29 \wj And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and
his raiment \add was\add*\wj*\wj  white \add and\add*\wj*\wj  glistering. 
\wj*
\v 30 \wj And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and
Elias: \wj*
\v 31 \wj Who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease which he should
accomplish at Jerusalem. \wj*
\v 32 \wj But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and
when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with
him. \wj*
\v 33 \wj And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said unto
Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three
tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing
what he said. \wj*
\v 34 \wj While he thus spake, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and
they feared as they entered into the cloud. \wj*
\v 35 \wj And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved
Son: hear him. \wj*
\v 36 \wj And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept 
\add it\add*\wj*\wj  close, and told no man in those days any of those things
which they had seen.\wj*
\p
\v 37 \wj And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down
from the hill, much people met him. \wj*
\v 38 \wj And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I
beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is mine only child. \wj*
\v 39 \wj And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it
teareth him that he foameth again, and bruising him hardly departeth from
him. \wj*
\v 40 \wj And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not. 
\wj*
\v 41 \wj And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how
long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring thy son hither. \wj*
\v 42 And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare 
\add him.\add* And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and
delivered him again to his father.
\p
\v 43 And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they
wondered every one at all things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
\v 44 \wj Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall
be delivered into the hands of men. \wj*
\v 45 But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they
perceived it not: and they feared to ask him of that saying.
\p
\v 46 Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be
greatest. 
\v 47 And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set
him by him, 
\v 48 And said unto them, \wj Whosoever shall receive this child in my name
receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for
he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 49 \wj And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in
thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us. \wj*
\v 50 \wj And Jesus said unto him, Forbid \add him\add*\wj*\wj  not: for he
that is not against us is for us.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 51 \wj And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be
received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, \wj*
\v 52 \wj And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into
a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him. \wj*
\v 53 \wj And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he
would go to Jerusalem. \wj*
\v 54 \wj And when his disciples James and John saw \add this,\add*\wj*
\wj  they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven,
and consume them, even as Elias did? \wj*
\v 55 \wj But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner
of spirit ye are of. \wj*
\v 56 \wj For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save 
\add them.\add*\wj*\wj  And they went to another village.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 57 \wj And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain 
\add man\add*\wj*\wj  said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever
thou goest. \wj*
\v 58 \wj And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air 
\add have\add*\wj*\wj  nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay 
\add his\add*\wj*\wj  head. \wj*
\v 59 And he said unto another, \wj Follow me.\wj* But he said, Lord, suffer
me first to go and bury my father. 
\v 60 Jesus said unto him, \wj Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and
preach the kingdom of God. \wj*
\v 61 And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go bid
them farewell, which are at home at my house. 
\v 62 And Jesus said unto him, \wj No man, having put his hand to the plough,
and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 10
\p
\v 1 \wj After these things the Lord appointed other seventy also, and sent
them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself
would come. \wj*
\v 2 \wj Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly \add is\add*
\wj*\wj  great, but the labourers \add are\add*\wj*\wj  few: pray ye therefore
the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.
\wj*
\v 3 \wj Go your ways: behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves. 
\wj*
\v 4 \wj Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the
way. \wj*
\v 5 \wj And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace \add be
\add*\wj*\wj  to this house. \wj*
\v 6 \wj And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if
not, it shall turn to you again. \wj*
\v 7 \wj And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they
give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 
\wj*
\v 8 \wj And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such
things as are set before you: \wj*
\v 9 \wj And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of
God is come nigh unto you. \wj*
\v 10 \wj But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your
ways out into the streets of the same, and say, \wj*
\v 11 \wj Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe
off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God
is come nigh unto you. \wj*
\v 12 \wj But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for
Sodom, than for that city. \wj*
\v 13 \wj Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty
works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a
great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. \wj*
\v 14 \wj But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment,
than for you. \wj*
\v 15 \wj And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust
down to hell. \wj*
\v 16 \wj He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth
me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 17 \wj And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the
devils are subject unto us through thy name. \wj*
\v 18 \wj And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
\wj*
\v 19 \wj Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions,
and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
\wj*
\v 20 \wj Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject
unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven.
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 21 \wj In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O
Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the
wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so
it seemed good in thy sight. \wj*
\v 22 \wj All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who
the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and 
\add he\add*\wj*\wj  to whom the Son will reveal \add him.\add*\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 23 \wj And he turned him unto \add his\add*\wj*\wj  disciples, and said
privately, Blessed \add are\add*\wj*\wj  the eyes which see the things that ye
see: \wj*
\v 24 \wj For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see
those things which ye see, and have not seen \add them;\add*\wj*\wj  and to
hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard \add them.\add*\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 25 \wj And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying,
Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? \wj*
\v 26 \wj He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? 
\wj*
\v 27 And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy
mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. 
\v 28 And he said unto him, \wj Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou
shalt live. \wj*
\v 29 But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my
neighbour? 
\v 30 And Jesus answering said, \wj A certain \add man\add*\wj*\wj  went down
from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his
raiment, and wounded \add him,\add*\wj*\wj  and departed, leaving \add him
\add*\wj*\wj  half dead. \wj*
\v 31 \wj And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he
saw him, he passed by on the other side. \wj*
\v 32 \wj And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked 
\add on him,\add*\wj*\wj  and passed by on the other side. \wj*
\v 33 \wj But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and
when he saw him, he had compassion \add on him, \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 34 \wj And went to \add him,\add*\wj*\wj  and bound up his wounds, pouring
in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and
took care of him. \wj*
\v 35 \wj And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave
\add them\add*\wj*\wj  to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and
whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. 
\wj*
\v 36 \wj Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that
fell among the thieves? \wj*
\v 37 And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, 
\wj Go, and do thou likewise.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 38 \wj Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain
village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. 
\wj*
\v 39 \wj And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus’ feet, and
heard his word. \wj*
\v 40 \wj But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and
said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid
her therefore that she help me. \wj*
\v 41 \wj And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art
careful and troubled about many things: \wj*
\v 42 \wj But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which
shall not be taken away from her.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 11
\p
\v 1 \wj And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when
he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John
also taught his disciples. \wj*
\v 2 \wj And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in
heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in
heaven, so in earth. \wj*
\v 3 \wj Give us day by day our daily bread. \wj*
\v 4 \wj And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is
indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. 
\wj*
\v 5 And he said unto them, \wj Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go
unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves; 
\wj*
\v 6 \wj For a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing
to set before him? \wj*
\v 7 \wj And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is
now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee. 
\wj*
\v 8 \wj I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is
his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many
as he needeth. \wj*
\v 9 \wj And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye
shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. \wj*
\v 10 \wj For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth;
and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. \wj*
\v 11 \wj If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he
give him a stone? or if \add he ask\add*\wj*\wj  a fish, will he for a fish
give him a serpent? \wj*
\v 12 \wj Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? \wj*
\v 13 \wj If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
children: how much more shall \add your\add*\wj*\wj  heavenly Father give the
Holy Spirit to them that ask him?\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 14 \wj And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to
pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spake; and the people wondered. 
\wj*
\v 15 \wj But some of them said, He casteth out devils through Beelzebub the
chief of the devils. \wj*
\v 16 \wj And others, tempting \add him,\add*\wj*\wj  sought of him a sign
from heaven. \wj*
\v 17 \wj But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom
divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house \add divided
\add*\wj*\wj  against a house falleth. \wj*
\v 18 \wj If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom
stand? because ye say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub. \wj*
\v 19 \wj And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast 
\add them\add*\wj*\wj  out? therefore shall they be your judges. \wj*
\v 20 \wj But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the
kingdom of God is come upon you. \wj*
\v 21 \wj When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
\wj*
\v 22 \wj But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and overcome him,
he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoils.
\wj*
\v 23 \wj He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with
me scattereth. \wj*
\v 24 \wj When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry
places, seeking rest; and finding none, he saith, I will return unto my house
whence I came out. \wj*
\v 25 \wj And when he cometh, he findeth \add it\add*\wj*\wj  swept and
garnished. \wj*
\v 26 \wj Then goeth he, and taketh \add to him\add*\wj*\wj  seven other
spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the
last \add state\add*\wj*\wj  of that man is worse than the first.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 27 \wj And it came to pass, as he spake these things, a certain woman of
the company lifted up her voice, and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that
bare thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. \wj*
\v 28 \wj But he said, Yea rather, blessed \add are\add*\wj*\wj  they that
hear the word of God, and keep it.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 29 \wj And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This
is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it,
but the sign of Jonas the prophet. \wj*
\v 30 \wj For as Jonas was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of
man be to this generation. \wj*
\v 31 \wj The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of
this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the
earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is
here. \wj*
\v 32 \wj The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas;
and, behold, a greater than Jonas \add is\add*\wj*\wj  here. \wj*
\v 33 \wj No man, when he hath lighted a candle, putteth \add it\add*
\wj*\wj  in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that
they which come in may see the light. \wj*
\v 34 \wj The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is
single, thy whole body also is full of light; but when \add thine eye
\add*\wj*\wj  is evil, thy body also \add is\add*\wj*\wj  full of darkness. 
\wj*
\v 35 \wj Take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not
darkness. \wj*
\v 36 \wj If thy whole body therefore \add be\add*\wj*\wj  full of light,
having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright
shining of a candle doth give thee light.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 37 \wj And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him:
and he went in, and sat down to meat. \wj*
\v 38 \wj And when the Pharisee saw \add it,\add*\wj*\wj  he marvelled that he
had not first washed before dinner. \wj*
\v 39 \wj And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the
outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening
and wickedness. \wj*
\v 40 \wj \add Ye\add*\wj*\wj  fools, did not he that made that which is
without make that which is within also? \wj*
\v 41 \wj But rather give alms of such things as ye have; and, behold, all
things are clean unto you. \wj*
\v 42 \wj But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all
manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to
have done, and not to leave the other undone. \wj*
\v 43 \wj Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the
synagogues, and greetings in the markets. \wj*
\v 44 \wj Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as
graves which appear not, and the men that walk over \add them\add*\wj*
\wj  are not aware \add of them.\add*\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 45 \wj Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus
saying thou reproachest us also. \wj*
\v 46 \wj And he said, Woe unto you also, \add ye\add*\wj*\wj  lawyers! for ye
lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the
burdens with one of your fingers. \wj*
\v 47 \wj Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your
fathers killed them. \wj*
\v 48 \wj Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for
they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres. \wj*
\v 49 \wj Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and
apostles, and \add some\add*\wj*\wj  of them they shall slay and persecute: 
\wj*
\v 50 \wj That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the
foundation of the world, may be required of this generation; \wj*
\v 51 \wj From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished
between the altar and the temple: verily I say unto you, It shall be required
of this generation. \wj*
\v 52 \wj Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge:
ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. 
\wj*
\v 53 And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees
began to urge \add him\add* vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many
things: 
\v 54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth,
that they might accuse him.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an innumerable
multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to
say unto his disciples first of all, \wj Beware ye of the leaven of the
Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. \wj*
\v 2 \wj For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither
hid, that shall not be known. \wj*
\v 3 \wj Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the
light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed
upon the housetops. \wj*
\v 4 \wj And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the
body, and after that have no more that they can do. \wj*
\v 5 \wj But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he
hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him. 
\wj*
\v 6 \wj Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is
forgotten before God? \wj*
\v 7 \wj But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not
therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows. \wj*
\v 8 \wj Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall
the Son of man also confess before the angels of God: \wj*
\v 9 \wj But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels
of God. \wj*
\v 10 \wj And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be
forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost it shall
not be forgiven. \wj*
\v 11 \wj And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and \add unto
\add*\wj*\wj  magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye
shall answer, or what ye shall say: \wj*
\v 12 \wj For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to
say.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 13 \wj And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my brother,
that he divide the inheritance with me. \wj*
\v 14 \wj And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over
you? \wj*
\v 15 And he said unto them, \wj Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a
man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
\wj*
\v 16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, \wj The ground of a certain
rich man brought forth plentifully: \wj*
\v 17 \wj And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I
have no room where to bestow my fruits? \wj*
\v 18 \wj And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build
greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. \wj*
\v 19 \wj And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for
many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, \add and\add*\wj*\wj  be merry. 
\wj*
\v 20 \wj But God said unto him, \add Thou\add*\wj*\wj  fool, this night thy
soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou
hast provided? \wj*
\v 21 \wj So \add is\add*\wj*\wj  he that layeth up treasure for himself, and
is not rich toward God.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 22 \wj And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no
thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall
put on. \wj*
\v 23 \wj The life is more than meat, and the body \add is more\add*
\wj*\wj  than raiment. \wj*
\v 24 \wj Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither
have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better
than the fowls? \wj*
\v 25 \wj And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one
cubit? \wj*
\v 26 \wj If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye
thought for the rest? \wj*
\v 27 \wj Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and
yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of
these. \wj*
\v 28 \wj If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and
to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more \add will he clothe\add*
\wj*\wj  you, O ye of little faith? \wj*
\v 29 \wj And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither
be ye of doubtful mind. \wj*
\v 30 \wj For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and
your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 31 \wj But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be
added unto you. \wj*
\v 32 \wj Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure to
give you the kingdom. \wj*
\v 33 \wj Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax
not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief
approacheth, neither moth corrupteth. \wj*
\v 34 \wj For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 
\wj*
\v 35 \wj Let your loins be girded about, and \add your\add*\wj*\wj  lights
burning; \wj*
\v 36 \wj And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he
will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open
unto him immediately. \wj*
\v 37 \wj Blessed \add are\add*\wj*\wj  those servants, whom the lord when he
cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself,
and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them. 
\wj*
\v 38 \wj And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
watch, and find \add them\add*\wj*\wj  so, blessed are those servants. 
\wj*
\v 39 \wj And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour
the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house
to be broken through. \wj*
\v 40 \wj Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour
when ye think not.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 41 \wj Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us,
or even to all? \wj*
\v 42 \wj And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom
\add his\add*\wj*\wj  lord shall make ruler over his household, to give 
\add them their\add*\wj*\wj  portion of meat in due season? \wj*
\v 43 \wj Blessed \add is\add*\wj*\wj  that servant, whom his lord when he
cometh shall find so doing. \wj*
\v 44 \wj Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that
he hath. \wj*
\v 45 \wj But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and
drink, and to be drunken; \wj*
\v 46 \wj The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for
\add him,\add*\wj*\wj  and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him
in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers. \wj*
\v 47 \wj And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not 
\add himself,\add*\wj*\wj  neither did according to his will, shall be beaten
with many \add stripes. \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 48 \wj But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall
be beaten with few \add stripes.\add*\wj*\wj  For unto whomsoever much is
given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of
him they will ask the more.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 49 \wj I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I if it be
already kindled? \wj*
\v 50 \wj But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened
till it be accomplished! \wj*
\v 51 \wj Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay;
but rather division: \wj*
\v 52 \wj For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three
against two, and two against three. \wj*
\v 53 \wj The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the
father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother;
the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against
her mother in law.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 54 \wj And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of the
west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is. \wj*
\v 55 \wj And when \add ye see\add*\wj*\wj  the south wind blow, ye say, There
will be heat; and it cometh to pass. \wj*
\v 56 \wj \add Ye\add*\wj*\wj  hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky
and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time? \wj*
\v 57 \wj Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 58 \wj When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, \add as thou
art\add*\wj*\wj  in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from
him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the
officer, and the officer cast thee into prison. \wj*
\v 59 \wj I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the
very last mite.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 13
\p
\v 1 \wj There were present at that season some that told him of the
Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. \wj*
\v 2 \wj And Jesus answering said unto them, Suppose ye that these Galilaeans
were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things? 
\wj*
\v 3 \wj I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
perish. \wj*
\v 4 \wj Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them,
think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? 
\wj*
\v 5 \wj I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
perish.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 6 \wj He spake also this parable; A certain \add man\add*\wj*\wj  had a fig
tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found
none. \wj*
\v 7 \wj Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three
years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why
cumbereth it the ground? \wj*
\v 8 \wj And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also,
till I shall dig about it, and dung \add it: \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 9 \wj And if it bear fruit, \add well:\add*\wj*\wj  and if not, \add then
\add*\wj*\wj  after that thou shalt cut it down. \wj*
\v 10 And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
\p
\v 11 And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen
years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up \add herself. 
\add*
\v 12 And when Jesus saw her, he called \add her to him,\add* and said unto
her, \wj Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. \wj*
\v 13 And he laid \add his\add* hands on her: and immediately she was made
straight, and glorified God. 
\v 14 And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that
Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six
days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not
on the sabbath day. 
\v 15 The Lord then answered him, and said, \wj \add Thou\add*\wj*\wj 
hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or \add his
\add*\wj*\wj  ass from the stall, and lead \add him\add*\wj*\wj  away to
watering? \wj*
\v 16 \wj And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan
hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath
day? \wj*
\v 17 And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and
all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
\p
\v 18 Then said he, \wj Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto
shall I resemble it? \wj*
\v 19 \wj It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into
his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air
lodged in the branches of it. \wj*
\v 20 And again he said, \wj Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? 
\wj*
\v 21 \wj It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of
meal, till the whole was leavened. \wj*
\v 22 And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying
toward Jerusalem. 
\v 23 Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said
unto them,
\p
\v 24 \wj Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you,
will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. \wj*
\v 25 \wj When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the
door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord,
Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not
whence ye are: \wj*
\v 26 \wj Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence,
and thou hast taught in our streets. \wj*
\v 27 \wj But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart
from me, all \add ye\add*\wj*\wj  workers of iniquity. \wj*
\v 28 \wj There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God,
and you \add yourselves\add*\wj*\wj  thrust out. \wj*
\v 29 \wj And they shall come from the east, and \add from\add*\wj*\wj  the
west, and from the north, and \add from\add*\wj*\wj  the south, and shall sit
down in the kingdom of God. \wj*
\v 30 \wj And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are
first which shall be last.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 31 \wj The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him,
Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee. \wj*
\v 32 \wj And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out
devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third \add day
\add*\wj*\wj  I shall be perfected. \wj*
\v 33 \wj Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the \add day
\add*\wj*\wj  following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of
Jerusalem. \wj*
\v 34 \wj O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them
that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children
together, as a hen \add doth gather\add*\wj*\wj  her brood under \add her
\add*\wj*\wj  wings, and ye would not! \wj*
\v 35 \wj Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto
you, Ye shall not see me, until \add the time\add*\wj*\wj  come when ye shall
say, Blessed \add is\add*\wj*\wj  he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 14
\p
\v 1 \wj And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief
Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. \wj*
\v 2 \wj And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the
dropsy. \wj*
\v 3 \wj And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is
it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? \wj*
\v 4 And they held their peace. And he took \add him,\add* and healed him, and
let him go; 
\v 5 And answered them, saying, \wj Which of you shall have an ass or an ox
fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? 
\wj*
\v 6 And they could not answer him again to these things.
\p
\v 7 And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how
they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, 
\v 8 \wj When thou art bidden of any \add man\add*\wj*\wj  to a wedding, sit
not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden
of him; \wj*
\v 9 \wj And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man
place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. \wj*
\v 10 \wj But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that
when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher:
then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with
thee. \wj*
\v 11 \wj For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth
himself shall be exalted.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 12 \wj Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or
a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor 
\add thy\add*\wj*\wj  rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a
recompence be made thee. \wj*
\v 13 \wj But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame,
the blind: \wj*
\v 14 \wj And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou
shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 15 \wj And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things,
he said unto him, Blessed \add is\add*\wj*\wj  he that shall eat bread in the
kingdom of God. \wj*
\v 16 \wj Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade
many: \wj*
\v 17 \wj And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden,
Come; for all things are now ready. \wj*
\v 18 \wj And they all with one \add consent\add*\wj*\wj  began to make
excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must
needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. \wj*
\v 19 \wj And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove
them: I pray thee have me excused. \wj*
\v 20 \wj And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot
come. \wj*
\v 21 \wj So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the
master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the
streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed,
and the halt, and the blind. \wj*
\v 22 \wj And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and
yet there is room. \wj*
\v 23 \wj And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and
hedges, and compel \add them\add*\wj*\wj  to come in, that my house may be
filled. \wj*
\v 24 \wj For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall
taste of my supper.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 25 \wj And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said
unto them, \wj*
\v 26 \wj If any \add man\add*\wj*\wj  come to me, and hate not his father,
and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his
own life also, he cannot be my disciple. \wj*
\v 27 \wj And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be
my disciple. \wj*
\v 28 \wj For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down
first, and counteth the cost, whether he have \add sufficient\add*\wj*
\wj  to finish \add it? \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 29 \wj Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to
finish \add it,\add*\wj*\wj  all that behold \add it\add*\wj*\wj  begin to
mock him, \wj*
\v 30 \wj Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. 
\wj*
\v 31 \wj Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not
down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him
that cometh against him with twenty thousand? \wj*
\v 32 \wj Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an
ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. \wj*
\v 33 \wj So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he
hath, he cannot be my disciple.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 34 \wj Salt \add is\add*\wj*\wj  good: but if the salt have lost his
savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? \wj*
\v 35 \wj It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; 
\add but\add*\wj*\wj  men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 15
\p
\v 1 \wj Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear
him. \wj*
\v 2 \wj And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth
sinners, and eateth with them.\wj*
\p
\v 3 \wj And he spake this parable unto them, saying, \wj*
\v 4 \wj What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them,
doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which
is lost, until he find it? \wj*
\v 5 \wj And when he hath found \add it,\add*\wj*\wj  he layeth \add it
\add*\wj*\wj  on his shoulders, rejoicing. \wj*
\v 6 \wj And when he cometh home, he calleth together \add his\add*\wj*
\wj  friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have
found my sheep which was lost. \wj*
\v 7 \wj I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner
that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no
repentance.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 8 \wj Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece,
doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she
find \add it? \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 9 \wj And when she hath found \add it,\add*\wj*\wj  she calleth \add her
\add*\wj*\wj  friends and \add her\add*\wj*\wj  neighbours together, saying,
Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost. \wj*
\v 10 \wj Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels
of God over one sinner that repenteth.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 11 \wj And he said, A certain man had two sons: \wj*
\v 12 \wj And the younger of them said to \add his\add*\wj*\wj  father,
Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth \add to me.\add*\wj*
\wj  And he divided unto them \add his\add*\wj*\wj  living. \wj*
\v 13 \wj And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and
took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with
riotous living. \wj*
\v 14 \wj And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land;
and he began to be in want. \wj*
\v 15 \wj And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he
sent him into his fields to feed swine. \wj*
\v 16 \wj And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. \wj*
\v 17 \wj And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my
father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! \wj*
\v 18 \wj I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I
have sinned against heaven, and before thee, \wj*
\v 19 \wj And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy
hired servants. \wj*
\v 20 \wj And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great
way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his
neck, and kissed him. \wj*
\v 21 \wj And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and
in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. \wj*
\v 22 \wj But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and
put \add it\add*\wj*\wj  on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on 
\add his\add*\wj*\wj  feet: \wj*
\v 23 \wj And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill \add it;\add*\wj*
\wj  and let us eat, and be merry: \wj*
\v 24 \wj For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is
found. And they began to be merry. \wj*
\v 25 \wj Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to
the house, he heard musick and dancing. \wj*
\v 26 \wj And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
meant. \wj*
\v 27 \wj And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. 
\wj*
\v 28 \wj And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father
out, and intreated him. \wj*
\v 29 \wj And he answering said to \add his\add*\wj*\wj  father, Lo, these
many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy
commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with
my friends: \wj*
\v 30 \wj But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living
with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. \wj*
\v 31 \wj And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I
have is thine. \wj*
\v 32 \wj It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy
brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 16
\p
\v 1 \wj And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man,
which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his
goods. \wj*
\v 2 \wj And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of
thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer
steward. \wj*
\v 3 \wj Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord
taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. 
\wj*
\v 4 \wj I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship,
they may receive me into their houses. \wj*
\v 5 \wj So he called every one of his lord’s debtors \add unto him,
\add*\wj*\wj  and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? 
\wj*
\v 6 \wj And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take
thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. \wj*
\v 7 \wj Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An
hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write
fourscore. \wj*
\v 8 \wj And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done
wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the
children of light. \wj*
\v 9 \wj And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of
unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting
habitations. \wj*
\v 10 \wj He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much:
and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. \wj*
\v 11 \wj If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon,
who will commit to your trust the true \add riches? \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 12 \wj And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s,
who shall give you that which is your own?\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 13 \wj No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye
cannot serve God and mammon. \wj*
\v 14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and
they derided him. 
\v 15 And he said unto them, \wj Ye are they which justify yourselves before
men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men
is abomination in the sight of God. \wj*
\v 16 \wj The law and the prophets \add were\add*\wj*\wj  until John: since
that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. 
\wj*
\v 17 \wj And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of
the law to fail. \wj*
\v 18 \wj Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth
adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from \add her
\add*\wj*\wj  husband committeth adultery.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 19 \wj There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine
linen, and fared sumptuously every day: \wj*
\v 20 \wj And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his
gate, full of sores, \wj*
\v 21 \wj And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich
man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. \wj*
\v 22 \wj And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the
angels into Abraham’s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; 
\wj*
\v 23 \wj And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth
Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. \wj*
\v 24 \wj And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send
Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue;
for I am tormented in this flame. \wj*
\v 25 \wj But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst
thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted,
and thou art tormented. \wj*
\v 26 \wj And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed:
so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass
to us, that \add would come\add*\wj*\wj  from thence. \wj*
\v 27 \wj Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send
him to my father’s house: \wj*
\v 28 \wj For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they
also come into this place of torment. \wj*
\v 29 \wj Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them
hear them. \wj*
\v 30 \wj And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the
dead, they will repent. \wj*
\v 31 \wj And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets,
neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 17
\p
\v 1 \wj Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences
will come: but woe \add unto him,\add*\wj*\wj  through whom they come! 
\wj*
\v 2 \wj It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little
ones.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 3 \wj Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke
him; and if he repent, forgive him. \wj*
\v 4 \wj And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times
in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him. 
\wj*
\v 5 And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith. 
\v 6 And the Lord said, \wj If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye
might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou
planted in the sea; and it should obey you. \wj*
\v 7 \wj But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will
say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to
meat? \wj*
\v 8 \wj And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and
gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou
shalt eat and drink? \wj*
\v 9 \wj Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were
commanded him? I trow not. \wj*
\v 10 \wj So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are
commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was
our duty to do.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 11 \wj And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through
the midst of Samaria and Galilee. \wj*
\v 12 \wj And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that
were lepers, which stood afar off: \wj*
\v 13 \wj And they lifted up \add their\add*\wj*\wj  voices, and said, Jesus,
Master, have mercy on us. \wj*
\v 14 \wj And when he saw \add them,\add*\wj*\wj  he said unto them, Go shew
yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they
were cleansed. \wj*
\v 15 And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a
loud voice glorified God, 
\v 16 And fell down on \add his\add* face at his feet, giving him thanks: and
he was a Samaritan. 
\v 17 And Jesus answering said, \wj Were there not ten cleansed? but where 
\add are\add*\wj*\wj  the nine? \wj*
\v 18 \wj There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this
stranger. \wj*
\v 19 And he said unto him, \wj Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee
whole.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 20 \wj And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God
should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with
observation: \wj*
\v 21 \wj Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the
kingdom of God is within you. \wj*
\v 22 And he said unto the disciples, \wj The days will come, when ye shall
desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see 
\add it. \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 23 \wj And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after 
\add them,\add*\wj*\wj  nor follow \add them. \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 24 \wj For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one \add part
\add*\wj*\wj  under heaven, shineth unto the other \add part\add*\wj*
\wj  under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day. \wj*
\v 25 \wj But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this
generation. \wj*
\v 26 \wj And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of
the Son of man. \wj*
\v 27 \wj They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in
marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and
destroyed them all. \wj*
\v 28 \wj Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they
drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; \wj*
\v 29 \wj But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
brimstone from heaven, and destroyed \add them\add*\wj*\wj  all. \wj*
\v 30 \wj Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. 
\wj*
\v 31 \wj In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in
the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field,
let him likewise not return back. \wj*
\v 32 \wj Remember Lot’s wife. \wj*
\v 33 \wj Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever
shall lose his life shall preserve it. \wj*
\v 34 \wj I tell you, in that night there shall be two \add men\add*
\wj*\wj  in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. 
\wj*
\v 35 \wj Two \add women\add*\wj*\wj  shall be grinding together; the one
shall be taken, and the other left. \wj*
\v 36 \wj Two \add men\add*\wj*\wj  shall be in the field; the one shall be
taken, and the other left. \wj*
\v 37 And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them,
\wj Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 18
\p
\v 1 \wj And he spake a parable unto them \add to this end,\add*\wj*\wj  that
men ought always to pray, and not to faint; \wj*
\v 2 \wj Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither
regarded man: \wj*
\v 3 \wj And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying,
Avenge me of mine adversary. \wj*
\v 4 \wj And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself,
Though I fear not God, nor regard man; \wj*
\v 5 \wj Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her
continual coming she weary me. \wj*
\v 6 And the Lord said, \wj Hear what the unjust judge saith. \wj*
\v 7 \wj And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto
him, though he bear long with them? \wj*
\v 8 \wj I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the
Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? \wj*
\v 9 And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that
they were righteous, and despised others: 
\v 10 \wj Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the
other a publican. \wj*
\v 11 \wj The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee,
that I am not as other men \add are,\add*\wj*\wj  extortioners, unjust,
adulterers, or even as this publican. \wj*
\v 12 \wj I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. 
\wj*
\v 13 \wj And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as 
\add his\add*\wj*\wj  eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God
be merciful to me a sinner. \wj*
\v 14 \wj I tell you, this man went down to his house justified \add rather
\add*\wj*\wj  than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be
abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. \wj*
\v 15 And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but
when \add his\add* disciples saw \add it,\add* they rebuked them. 
\v 16 But Jesus called them \add unto him,\add* and said, \wj Suffer little
children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of
God. \wj*
\v 17 \wj Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of
God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. \wj*
\v 18 And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to
inherit eternal life? 
\v 19 And Jesus said unto him, \wj Why callest thou me good? none \add is
\add*\wj*\wj  good, save one, \add that is,\add*\wj*\wj  God. \wj*
\v 20 \wj Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill,
Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. 
\wj*
\v 21 And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. 
\v 22 Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, \wj Yet lackest
thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and
thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me. \wj*
\v 23 And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. 
\v 24 And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, \wj How hardly
shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! \wj*
\v 25 \wj For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for
a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. \wj*
\v 26 And they that heard \add it\add* said, Who then can be saved? 
\v 27 And he said, \wj The things which are impossible with men are possible
with God. \wj*
\v 28 Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. 
\v 29 And he said unto them, \wj Verily I say unto you, There is no man that
hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the
kingdom of God’s sake, \wj*
\v 30 \wj Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the
world to come life everlasting.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 31 \wj Then he took \add unto him\add*\wj*\wj  the twelve, and said unto
them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the
prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. \wj*
\v 32 \wj For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked,
and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: \wj*
\v 33 \wj And they shall scourge \add him,\add*\wj*\wj  and put him to death:
and the third day he shall rise again. \wj*
\v 34 And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from
them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.
\p
\v 35 And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain
blind man sat by the way side begging: 
\v 36 And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. 
\v 37 And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by. 
\v 38 And he cried, saying, Jesus, \add thou\add* Son of David, have mercy on
me. 
\v 39 And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace:
but he cried so much the more, \add Thou\add* Son of David, have mercy on me.
\v 40 And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he
was come near, he asked him, 
\v 41 Saying, \wj What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee?\wj* And he said,
Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
\v 42 And Jesus said unto him, \wj Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved
thee. \wj*
\v 43 And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God:
and all the people, when they saw \add it,\add* gave praise unto God.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 And \add Jesus\add* entered and passed through Jericho. 
\v 2 And, behold, \add there was\add* a man named Zacchaeus, which was the
chief among the publicans, and he was rich. 
\v 3 And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press,
because he was little of stature. 
\v 4 And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he
was to pass that \add way. \add*
\v 5 And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said
unto him, \wj Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at
thy house. \wj*
\v 6 And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. 
\v 7 And when they saw \add it,\add* they all murmured, saying, That he was
gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. 
\v 8 And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my
goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false
accusation, I restore \add him\add* fourfold. 
\v 9 And Jesus said unto him, \wj This day is salvation come to this house,
forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. \wj*
\v 10 \wj For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
\wj*
\v 11 And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he
was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should
immediately appear. 
\v 12 He said therefore, \wj A certain nobleman went into a far country to
receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. \wj*
\v 13 \wj And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and
said unto them, Occupy till I come. \wj*
\v 14 \wj But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We
will not have this \add man\add*\wj*\wj  to reign over us. \wj*
\v 15 \wj And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the
kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he
had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by
trading. \wj*
\v 16 \wj Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
\wj*
\v 17 \wj And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast
been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. 
\wj*
\v 18 \wj And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five
pounds. \wj*
\v 19 \wj And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. 
\wj*
\v 20 \wj And another came, saying, Lord, behold, \add here is\add*\wj*
\wj  thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: \wj*
\v 21 \wj For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up
that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. \wj*
\v 22 \wj And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, 
\add thou\add*\wj*\wj  wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man,
taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: \wj*
\v 23 \wj Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my
coming I might have required mine own with usury? \wj*
\v 24 \wj And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and
give \add it\add*\wj*\wj  to him that hath ten pounds. \wj*
\v 25 \wj (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) \wj*
\v 26 \wj For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given;
and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. 
\wj*
\v 27 \wj But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over
them, bring hither, and slay \add them\add*\wj*\wj  before me.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 28 \wj And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to
Jerusalem. \wj*
\v 29 \wj And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany,
at the mount called \add the mount\add*\wj*\wj  of Olives, he sent two of his
disciples, \wj*
\v 30 \wj Saying, Go ye into the village over against \add you;\add*
\wj*\wj  in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet
never man sat: loose him, and bring \add him hither. \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 31 \wj And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose \add him?\add*\wj*\wj  thus
shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. \wj*
\v 32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said
unto them. 
\v 33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them,
Why loose ye the colt? 
\v 34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him. 
\v 35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the
colt, and they set Jesus thereon. 
\v 36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. 
\v 37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of
Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God
with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; 
\v 38 Saying, Blessed \add be\add* the King that cometh in the name of the
Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. 
\v 39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him,
Master, rebuke thy disciples. 
\v 40 And he answered and said unto them, \wj I tell you that, if these should
hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 41 \wj And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, 
\wj*
\v 42 \wj Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day,
the things \add which belong\add*\wj*\wj  unto thy peace! but now they are hid
from thine eyes. \wj*
\v 43 \wj For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a
trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, 
\wj*
\v 44 \wj And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within
thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou
knewest not the time of thy visitation. \wj*
\v 45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold
therein, and them that bought; 
\v 46 Saying unto them, \wj It is written, My house is the house of prayer:
but ye have made it a den of thieves. \wj*
\v 47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes
and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, 
\v 48 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very
attentive to hear him.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, \add that\add* on one of those days, as he taught
the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the
scribes came upon \add him\add* with the elders, 
\v 2 And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these
things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? 
\v 3 And he answered and said unto them, \wj I will also ask you one thing;
and answer me: \wj*
\v 4 \wj The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? \wj*
\v 5 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven;
he will say, Why then believed ye him not? 
\v 6 But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be
persuaded that John was a prophet. 
\v 7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence \add it was. 
\add*
\v 8 And Jesus said unto them, \wj Neither tell I you by what authority I do
these things. \wj*
\v 9 Then began he to speak to the people this parable; \wj A certain man
planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far
country for a long time. \wj*
\v 10 \wj And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they
should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him,
and sent \add him\add*\wj*\wj  away empty. \wj*
\v 11 \wj And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and
entreated \add him\add*\wj*\wj  shamefully, and sent \add him\add*\wj*
\wj  away empty. \wj*
\v 12 \wj And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast 
\add him\add*\wj*\wj  out. \wj*
\v 13 \wj Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my
beloved son: it may be they will reverence \add him\add*\wj*\wj  when they see
him. \wj*
\v 14 \wj But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves,
saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be
ours. \wj*
\v 15 \wj So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed \add him.
\add*\wj*\wj  What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them? 
\wj*
\v 16 \wj He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the
vineyard to others.\wj* And when they heard \add it,\add* they said, God
forbid. 
\v 17 And he beheld them, and said, \wj What is this then that is written, The
stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
\wj*
\v 18 \wj Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on
whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 19 \wj And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay
hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had
spoken this parable against them. \wj*
\v 20 \wj And they watched \add him,\add*\wj*\wj  and sent forth spies, which
should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that
so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor. 
\wj*
\v 21 \wj And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and
teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person \add of any,\add*
\wj*\wj  but teachest the way of God truly: \wj*
\v 22 \wj Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or no? \wj*
\v 23 \wj But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, Why tempt ye
me? \wj*
\v 24 \wj Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it?\wj* They
answered and said, Caesar’s. 
\v 25 And he said unto them, \wj Render therefore unto Caesar the things which
be Caesar’s, and unto God the things which be God’s. \wj*
\v 26 And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they
marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
\p
\v 27 Then came to \add him\add* certain of the Sadducees, which deny that
there is any resurrection; and they asked him, 
\v 28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a
wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and
raise up seed unto his brother. 
\v 29 There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died
without children. 
\v 30 And the second took her to wife, and he died childless. 
\v 31 And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left
no children, and died. 
\v 32 Last of all the woman died also. 
\v 33 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had
her to wife. 
\v 34 And Jesus answering said unto them, \wj The children of this world
marry, and are given in marriage: \wj*
\v 35 \wj But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and
the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: 
\wj*
\v 36 \wj Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels;
and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. 
\wj*
\v 37 \wj Now that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the bush, when
he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob. \wj*
\v 38 \wj For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live
unto him.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 39 \wj Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well
said. \wj*
\v 40 \wj And after that they durst not ask him any \add question at all. 
\add*\wj*
\v 41 \wj And he said unto them, How say they that Christ is David’s son? 
\wj*
\v 42 \wj And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my
Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, \wj*
\v 43 \wj Till I make thine enemies thy footstool. \wj*
\v 44 \wj David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 45 \wj Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples, 
\wj*
\v 46 \wj Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love
greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the
chief rooms at feasts; \wj*
\v 47 \wj Which devour widows’ houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the
same shall receive greater damnation.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\c 21
\p
\v 1 \wj And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the
treasury. \wj*
\v 2 \wj And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites. 
\wj*
\v 3 \wj And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow hath
cast in more than they all: \wj*
\v 4 \wj For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of
God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had.
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 5 \wj And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly
stones and gifts, he said, \wj*
\v 6 \wj \add As for\add*\wj*\wj  these things which ye behold, the days will
come, in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall
not be thrown down. \wj*
\v 7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and
what sign \add will there be\add* when these things shall come to pass? 
\v 8 And he said, \wj Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall come
in my name, saying, I am \add Christ;\add*\wj*\wj  and the time draweth near:
go ye not therefore after them. \wj*
\v 9 \wj But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified: for
these things must first come to pass; but the end \add is\add*\wj*\wj  not by
and by. \wj*
\v 10 Then said he unto them, \wj Nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom: \wj*
\v 11 \wj And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and
pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven. 
\wj*
\v 12 \wj But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
persecute \add you,\add*\wj*\wj  delivering \add you\add*\wj*\wj  up to the
synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before kings and rulers for my
name’s sake. \wj*
\v 13 \wj And it shall turn to you for a testimony. \wj*
\v 14 \wj Settle \add it\add*\wj*\wj  therefore in your hearts, not to
meditate before what ye shall answer: \wj*
\v 15 \wj For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries
shall not be able to gainsay nor resist. \wj*
\v 16 \wj And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
kinsfolks, and friends; and \add some\add*\wj*\wj  of you shall they cause to
be put to death. \wj*
\v 17 \wj And ye shall be hated of all \add men\add*\wj*\wj  for my name’s
sake. \wj*
\v 18 \wj But there shall not an hair of your head perish. \wj*
\v 19 \wj In your patience possess ye your souls. \wj*
\v 20 \wj And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know
that the desolation thereof is nigh. \wj*
\v 21 \wj Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and let
them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that are in the
countries enter thereinto. \wj*
\v 22 \wj For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
written may be fulfilled. \wj*
\v 23 \wj But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck,
in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon
this people. \wj*
\v 24 \wj And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away
captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles,
until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 25 \wj And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the
stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and
the waves roaring; \wj*
\v 26 \wj Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be
shaken. \wj*
\v 27 \wj And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power
and great glory. \wj*
\v 28 \wj And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift
up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh. \wj*
\v 29 And he spake to them a parable; \wj Behold the fig tree, and all the
trees; \wj*
\v 30 \wj When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that
summer is now nigh at hand. \wj*
\v 31 \wj So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that
the kingdom of God is nigh at hand. \wj*
\v 32 \wj Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away, till all
be fulfilled. \wj*
\v 33 \wj Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 34 \wj And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so
that day come upon you unawares. \wj*
\v 35 \wj For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of
the whole earth. \wj*
\v 36 \wj Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy
to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the
Son of man. \wj*
\v 37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night he went
out, and abode in the mount that is called \add the mount\add* of Olives. 
\v 38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple, for
to hear him.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the
Passover. 
\v 2 And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for
they feared the people.
\p
\v 3 Then entered Satan into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of
the twelve. 
\v 4 And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains,
how he might betray him unto them. 
\v 5 And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
\v 6 And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the
absence of the multitude.
\p
\v 7 Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed.
\v 8 And he sent Peter and John, saying, \wj Go and prepare us the passover,
that we may eat. \wj*
\v 9 And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 
\v 10 And he said unto them, \wj Behold, when ye are entered into the city,
there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the
house where he entereth in. \wj*
\v 11 \wj And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith
unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my
disciples? \wj*
\v 12 \wj And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make
ready. \wj*
\v 13 And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready
the passover. 
\v 14 And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with
him. 
\v 15 And he said unto them, \wj With desire I have desired to eat this
passover with you before I suffer: \wj*
\v 16 \wj For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be
fulfilled in the kingdom of God. \wj*
\v 17 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, \wj Take this, and
divide \add it\add*\wj*\wj  among yourselves: \wj*
\v 18 \wj For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until
the kingdom of God shall come.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 19 \wj And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake \add it,\add*
\wj*\wj  and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you:
this do in remembrance of me. \wj*
\v 20 Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, \wj This cup \add is
\add*\wj*\wj  the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 21 \wj But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me \add is\add*
\wj*\wj  with me on the table. \wj*
\v 22 \wj And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto
that man by whom he is betrayed! \wj*
\v 23 And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that
should do this thing.
\p
\v 24 And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be
accounted the greatest. 
\v 25 And he said unto them, \wj The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship
over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors.
\wj*
\v 26 \wj But ye \add shall\add*\wj*\wj  not \add be\add*\wj*\wj  so: but he
that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief,
as he that doth serve. \wj*
\v 27 \wj For whether \add is\add*\wj*\wj  greater, he that sitteth at meat,
or he that serveth? \add is\add*\wj*\wj  not he that sitteth at meat? but I am
among you as he that serveth. \wj*
\v 28 \wj Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. 
\wj*
\v 29 \wj And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto
me; \wj*
\v 30 \wj That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 31 \wj And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired 
\add to have\add*\wj*\wj  you, that he may sift \add you\add*\wj*\wj  as
wheat: \wj*
\v 32 \wj But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou
art converted, strengthen thy brethren. \wj*
\v 33 And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into
prison, and to death. 
\v 34 And he said, \wj I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day,
before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. \wj*
\v 35 And he said unto them, \wj When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and
shoes, lacked ye any thing?\wj* And they said, Nothing. 
\v 36 Then said he unto them, \wj But now, he that hath a purse, let him take
\add it,\add*\wj*\wj  and likewise \add his\add*\wj*\wj  scrip: and he that
hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. \wj*
\v 37 \wj For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be
accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the
things concerning me have an end. \wj*
\v 38 And they said, Lord, behold, here \add are\add* two swords. And he said
unto them, \wj It is enough.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 39 \wj And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives;
and his disciples also followed him. \wj*
\v 40 \wj And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter
not into temptation. \wj*
\v 41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s cast, and kneeled down,
and prayed, 
\v 42 Saying, \wj Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me:
nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. \wj*
\v 43 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 
\v 44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it
were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. 
\v 45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found
them sleeping for sorrow, 
\v 46 And said unto them, \wj Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into
temptation.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 47 \wj And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called
Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss
him. \wj*
\v 48 \wj But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a
kiss? \wj*
\v 49 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto
him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
\p
\v 50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his
right ear. 
\v 51 And Jesus answered and said, \wj Suffer ye thus far.\wj* And he touched
his ear, and healed him. 
\v 52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and
the elders, which were come to him, \wj Be ye come out, as against a thief,
with swords and staves? \wj*
\v 53 \wj When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands
against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 54 \wj Then took they him, and led \add him,\add*\wj*\wj  and brought him
into the high priest’s house. And Peter followed afar off. \wj*
\v 55 \wj And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were
set down together, Peter sat down among them. \wj*
\v 56 \wj But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly
looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. \wj*
\v 57 \wj And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. \wj*
\v 58 \wj And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of
them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. \wj*
\v 59 \wj And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed,
saying, Of a truth this \add fellow\add*\wj*\wj  also was with him: for he is
a Galilaean. \wj*
\v 60 \wj And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately,
while he yet spake, the cock crew. \wj*
\v 61 \wj And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the
word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt
deny me thrice. \wj*
\v 62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
\p
\v 63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote \add him. \add*
\v 64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and
asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? 
\v 65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
\p
\v 66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief
priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council,
saying, 
\v 67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, \wj If I tell you,
ye will not believe: \wj*
\v 68 \wj And if I also ask \add you,\add*\wj*\wj  ye will not answer me, nor
let \add me\add*\wj*\wj  go. \wj*
\v 69 \wj Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of
God. \wj*
\v 70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them,
\wj Ye say that I am. \wj*
\v 71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have
heard of his own mouth.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate. 
\v 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this \add fellow
\add* perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying
that he himself is Christ a King. 
\v 3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
answered him and said, \wj Thou sayest \add it. \add*\wj*\wj*
\v 4 \wj Then said Pilate to the chief priests and \add to\add*\wj*\wj  the
people, I find no fault in this man. \wj*
\v 5 \wj And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people,
teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. 
\wj*
\v 6 \wj When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
Galilaean. \wj*
\v 7 \wj And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he
sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.\wj*
\p
\v 8 \wj And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous
to see him of a long \add season,\add*\wj*\wj  because he had heard many
things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. \wj*
\v 9 \wj Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
nothing. \wj*
\v 10 \wj And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
\wj*
\v 11 \wj And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked 
\add him,\add*\wj*\wj  and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again
to Pilate.\wj*
\p
\v 12 \wj And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for
before they were at enmity between themselves.\wj*
\p
\v 13 \wj And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the
rulers and the people, \wj*
\v 14 \wj Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that
perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined \add him\add*
\wj*\wj  before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things
whereof ye accuse him: \wj*
\v 15 \wj No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of
death is done unto him. \wj*
\v 16 \wj I will therefore chastise him, and release \add him. \add*
\wj*
\v 17 \wj (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 
\wj*
\v 18 \wj And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this \add man,
\add*\wj*\wj  and release unto us Barabbas: \wj*
\v 19 \wj (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was
cast into prison.) \wj*
\v 20 \wj Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. 
\wj*
\v 21 \wj But they cried, saying, Crucify \add him,\add*\wj*\wj  crucify him.
\wj*
\v 22 \wj And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I
have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let 
\add him\add*\wj*\wj  go. \wj*
\v 23 \wj And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be
crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 
\wj*
\v 24 \wj And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. 
\wj*
\v 25 \wj And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast
into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. 
\wj*
\v 26 \wj And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian,
coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear
\add it\add*\wj*\wj  after Jesus.\wj*
\p
\v 27 \wj And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
which also bewailed and lamented him. \wj*
\v 28 \wj But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not
for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. \wj*
\v 29 \wj For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
Blessed \add are\add*\wj*\wj  the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and
the paps which never gave suck. \wj*
\v 30 \wj Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to
the hills, Cover us. \wj*
\v 31 \wj For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in
the dry? \wj*
\v 32 And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to
death. 
\v 33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there
they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other
on the left.
\p
\v 34 Then said Jesus, \wj Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
do.\wj* And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. 
\v 35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided 
\add him,\add* saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ,
the chosen of God. 
\v 36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him
vinegar, 
\v 37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. 
\v 38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and
Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\p
\v 39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If
thou be Christ, save thyself and us. 
\v 40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God,
seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
\v 41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but
this man hath done nothing amiss. 
\v 42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy
kingdom. 
\v 43 And Jesus said unto him, \wj Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou
be with me in paradise. \wj*
\v 44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the
earth until the ninth hour. 
\v 45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the
midst.
\p
\v 46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, \wj Father, into
thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. 
\wj*
\v 47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying,
Certainly this was a righteous man. 
\v 48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the
things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 
\v 49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee,
stood afar off, beholding these things.
\p
\v 50 And, behold, \add there was\add* a man named Joseph, a counsellor; 
\add and he was\add* a good man, and a just: 
\v 51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) 
\add he was\add* of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited
for the kingdom of God. 
\v 52 This \add man\add* went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. 
\v 53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre
that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. 
\v 54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. 
\v 55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after,
and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 
\v 56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the
sabbath day according to the commandment.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Now upon the first \add day\add* of the week, very early in the morning,
they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and
certain \add others\add* with them. 
\v 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. 
\v 3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two
men stood by them in shining garments: 
\v 5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down \add their\add* faces to the
earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 
\v 6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was
yet in Galilee, 
\v 7 Saying, \wj The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful
men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. \wj*
\v 8 And they remembered his words, 
\v 9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the
eleven, and to all the rest. 
\v 10 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary \add the mother\add* of
James, and other \add women that were\add* with them, which told these things
unto the apostles. 
\v 11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them
not. 
\v 12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he
beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in
himself at that which was come to pass.
\p
\v 13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus,
which was from Jerusalem \add about\add* threescore furlongs. 
\v 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 
\v 15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed \add together\add* and
reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 
\v 16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
\v 17 And he said unto them, \wj What manner of communications \add are
\add*\wj*\wj  these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? 
\wj*
\v 18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him,
Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are
come to pass there in these days? 
\v 19 And he said unto them, \wj What things?\wj* And they said unto him,
Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word
before God and all the people: 
\v 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned
to death, and have crucified him. 
\v 21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel:
and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. 
\v 22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which
were early at the sepulchre; 
\v 23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also
seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 
\v 24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found
\add it\add* even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. 
\v 25 Then he said unto them, \wj O fools, and slow of heart to believe all
that the prophets have spoken: \wj*
\v 26 \wj Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into
his glory? \wj*
\v 27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in
all the scriptures the things concerning himself. 
\v 28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as
though he would have gone further. 
\v 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward
evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. 
\v 30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and
blessed \add it,\add* and brake, and gave to them. 
\v 31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of
their sight. 
\v 32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he
talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 
\v 33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the
eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 
\v 34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 
\v 35 And they told what things \add were done\add* in the way, and how he was
known of them in breaking of bread.
\p
\v 36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and
saith unto them, \wj Peace \add be\add*\wj*\wj  unto you. \wj*
\v 37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen
a spirit. 
\v 38 And he said unto them, \wj Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts
arise in your hearts? \wj*
\v 39 \wj Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and
see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. \wj*
\v 40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them \add his\add* hands and 
\add his\add* feet. 
\v 41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto
them, \wj Have ye here any meat? \wj*
\v 42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. 
\v 43 And he took \add it,\add* and did eat before them. 
\v 44 And he said unto them, \wj These \add are\add*\wj*\wj  the words which I
spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled,
which were written in the law of Moses, and \add in\add*\wj*\wj  the prophets,
and \add in\add*\wj*\wj  the psalms, concerning me. \wj*
\v 45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the
scriptures, 
\v 46 And said unto them, \wj Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ
to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: \wj*
\v 47 \wj And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his
name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. \wj*
\v 48 \wj And ye are witnesses of these things.\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 49 \wj And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye
in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high.
\wj*
\p
\wj*
\v 50 \wj And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
hands, and blessed them. \wj*
\v 51 \wj And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them,
and carried up into heaven. \wj*
\v 52 \wj And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: 
\wj*
\v 53 \wj And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
Amen.
