\p
\v 1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see. 
\v 2 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! \add even
\add* cry out unto thee \add of\add* violence, and thou wilt not save! 
\v 3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause \add me\add* to behold
grievance? for spoiling and violence \add are\add* before me: and there are 
\add that\add* raise up strife and contention. 
\v 4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the
wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.
\p
\v 5 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for 
\add I\add* will work a work in your days, \add which\add* ye will not
believe, though it be told \add you. \add*
\v 6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, \add that\add* bitter and hasty
nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the
dwellingplaces \add that are\add* not theirs. 
\v 7 They \add are\add* terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
dignity shall proceed of themselves. 
\v 8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than
the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their
horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle \add that
\add* hasteth to eat. 
\v 9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up \add as
\add* the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. 
\v 10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto
them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take
it. 
\v 11 Then shall \add his\add* mind change, and he shall pass over, and
offend, \add imputing\add* this his power unto his god.
\p
\v 12 \add Art\add* thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty
God, thou hast established them for correction. 
\v 13 \add Thou art\add* of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look
on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, 
\add and\add* holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth \add the man that
is\add* more righteous than he? 
\v 14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, 
\add that have\add* no ruler over them? 
\v 15 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net,
and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad. 
\v 16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their
drag; because by them their portion \add is\add* fat, and their meat
plenteous. 
\v 17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay
the nations?

\p
\v 1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to
see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved. 
\v 2 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make 
\add it\add* plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it. 
\v 3 For the vision \add is\add* yet for an appointed time, but at the end it
shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely
come, it will not tarry. 
\v 4 Behold, his soul \add which\add* is lifted up is not upright in him: but
the just shall live by his faith.
\p
\v 5 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, \add he is\add* a proud man,
neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and \add is
\add* as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations,
and heapeth unto him all people: 
\v 6 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb
against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth \add that which is
\add* not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay! 
\v 7 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that
shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them? 
\v 8 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people
shall spoil thee; because of men’s blood, and \add for\add* the violence of
the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
\p
\v 9 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may
set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil! 
\v 10 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and
hast sinned \add against\add* thy soul. 
\v 11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber
shall answer it.
\p
\v 12 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by
iniquity! 
\v 13 Behold, \add is it\add* not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall
labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very
vanity? 
\v 14 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the
LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
\p
\v 15 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to
\add him,\add* and makest \add him\add* drunken also, that thou mayest look on
their nakedness! 
\v 16 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy
foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD’S right hand shall be turned unto
thee, and shameful spewing \add shall be\add* on thy glory. 
\v 17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, 
\add which\add* made them afraid, because of men’s blood, and for the violence
of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.
\p
\v 18 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it;
the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth
therein, to make dumb idols? 
\v 19 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it
shall teach! Behold, it \add is\add* laid over with gold and silver, and 
\add there is\add* no breath at all in the midst of it. 
\v 20 But the LORD \add is\add* in his holy temple: let all the earth keep
silence before him.

\p
\v 1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth. 
\v 2 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, \add and\add* was afraid: O LORD, revive
thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in
wrath remember mercy. 
\v 3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory
covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise. 
\v 4 And \add his\add* brightness was as the light; he had horns \add coming
\add* out of his hand: and there \add was\add* the hiding of his power. 
\v 5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his
feet. 
\v 6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the
nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did
bow: his ways \add are\add* everlasting. 
\v 7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: \add and\add* the curtains of
the land of Midian did tremble. 
\v 8 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? \add was\add* thine anger
against the rivers? \add was\add* thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst
ride upon thine horses \add and\add* thy chariots of salvation? 
\v 9 Thy bow was made quite naked, \add according\add* to the oaths of the
tribes, \add even thy\add* word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with
rivers. 
\v 10 The mountains saw thee, \add and\add* they trembled: the overflowing of
the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, \add and\add* lifted up his
hands on high. 
\v 11 The sun \add and\add* moon stood still in their habitation: at the light
of thine arrows they went, \add and\add* at the shining of thy glittering
spear. 
\v 12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the
heathen in anger. 
\v 13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, \add even
\add* for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the
house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah. 
\v 14 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they
came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing \add was\add* as to
devour the poor secretly. 
\v 15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, \add through
\add* the heap of great waters. 
\v 16 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice:
rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest
in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them
with his troops.
\p
\v 17 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither \add shall\add* fruit 
\add be\add* in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields
shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and \add there
shall be\add* no herd in the stalls: 
\v 18 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my salvation. 
\v 19 The LORD God \add is\add* my strength, and he will make my feet like
hinds’ \add feet,\add* and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To
the chief singer on my stringed instruments.
