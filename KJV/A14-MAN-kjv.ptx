\v 1 O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of
their righteous seed; 
\v 2 who hast made heaven and earth, with all the ornament thereof; 
\v 3 who hast bound the sea by the word of thy commandment; who hast shut up
the deep, and sealed it by thy terrible and glorious name; 
\v 4 whom all men fear, and tremble before thy power; for the majesty of thy
glory cannot be borne, and thine angry threatening toward sinners is
importable: 
\v 5 but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable and unsearchable; 
\v 6 for thou art the most high Lord, of great compassion, longsuffering, very
merciful, and repentest of the evils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy
great goodness hast promised repentance and forgiveness to them that have
sinned against thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointed repentance
unto sinners, that they may be saved. 
\v 7 Thou therefore, O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointed
repentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, which have not
sinned against thee; but thou hast appointed repentance unto me that am a
sinner: 
\v 8 for I have sinned above the number of the sands of the sea. My
transgressions, O Lord, are multiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and
I am not worthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitude of
mine iniquities. 
\v 9 I am bowed down with many iron bands, that I cannot lift up mine head,
neither have any release: for I have provoked thy wrath, and done evil before
thee: I did not thy will, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set up
abominations, and have multiplied offences. 
\v 10 Now therefore I bow the knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. 
\v 11 I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine
iniquities: 
\v 12 wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgive me, and
destroy me not with mine iniquites. Be not angry with me for ever, by
reserving evil for me; neither condemn me to the lower parts of the earth. For
thou art the God, even the God of them that repent; 
\v 13 and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: for thou wilt save me, that
am unworthy, according to thy great mercy. 
\v 14 Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of my life: for all
the powers of the heavens do praise thee, and thine is the glory for ever and
ever. Amen.
