\h 1 Corinthians
\mt The First Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul, called \add to be\add* an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will
of God, and Sosthenes \add our\add* brother, 
\v 2 Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified
in Christ Jesus, called \add to be\add* saints, with all that in every place
call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours: 
\v 3 Grace \add be\add* unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and 
\add from\add* the Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 4 I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given
you by Jesus Christ; 
\v 5 That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and 
\add in\add* all knowledge; 
\v 6 Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you: 
\v 7 So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord
Jesus Christ: 
\v 8 Who shall also confirm you unto the end, \add that ye may be\add*
blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 9 God \add is\add* faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of
his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
\p
\v 10 Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
ye all speak the same thing, and \add that\add* there be no divisions among
you; but \add that\add* ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and
in the same judgment. 
\v 11 For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them 
\add which are of the house\add* of Chloe, that there are contentions among
you. 
\v 12 Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of
Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ. 
\v 13 Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in
the name of Paul? 
\v 14 I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius; 
\v 15 Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name. 
\v 16 And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not
whether I baptized any other. 
\v 17 For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with
wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
\p
\v 18 For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but
unto us which are saved it is the power of God. 
\v 19 For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring
to nothing the understanding of the prudent. 
\v 20 Where \add is\add* the wise? where \add is\add* the scribe? where 
\add is\add* the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom
of this world? 
\v 21 For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it
pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe. 
\v 22 For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom: 
\v 23 But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto
the Greeks foolishness; 
\v 24 But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power
of God, and the wisdom of God. 
\v 25 Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of
God is stronger than men. 
\v 26 For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the
flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, \add are called: \add*
\v 27 But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the
wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things
which are mighty; 
\v 28 And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God
chosen, \add yea,\add* and things which are not, to bring to nought things
that are: 
\v 29 That no flesh should glory in his presence. 
\v 30 But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom,
and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption: 
\v 31 That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech
or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God. 
\v 2 For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and
him crucified. 
\v 3 And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 
\v 4 And my speech and my preaching \add was\add* not with enticing words of
man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: 
\v 5 That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power
of God. 
\v 6 Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom
of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought: 
\v 7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, \add even\add* the hidden 
\add wisdom,\add* which God ordained before the world unto our glory: 
\v 8 Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known 
\add it,\add* they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
\v 9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have
entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them
that love him. 
\v 10 But God hath revealed \add them\add* unto us by his Spirit: for the
Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. 
\v 11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which
is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 
\v 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which
is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. 
\v 13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom
teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with
spiritual. 
\v 14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for
they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know \add them,\add* because
they are spiritually discerned. 
\v 15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of
no man. 
\v 16 For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But
we have the mind of Christ.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto
carnal, \add even\add* as unto babes in Christ. 
\v 2 I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not
able \add to bear it,\add* neither yet now are ye able.
\p
\v 3 For ye are yet carnal: for whereas \add there is\add* among you envying,
and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? 
\v 4 For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I \add am\add* of
Apollos; are ye not carnal? 
\v 5 Who then is Paul, and who \add is\add* Apollos, but ministers by whom ye
believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? 
\v 6 I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. 
\v 7 So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth;
but God that giveth the increase. 
\v 8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall
receive his own reward according to his own labour. 
\v 9 For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, 
\add ye are\add* God’s building. 
\v 10 According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise
masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But
let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. 
\v 11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus
Christ. 
\v 12 Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones,
wood, hay, stubble; 
\v 13 Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it,
because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work
of what sort it is. 
\v 14 If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive
a reward. 
\v 15 If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself
shall be saved; yet so as by fire. 
\v 16 Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and \add that\add* the Spirit
of God dwelleth in you? 
\v 17 If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the
temple of God is holy, which \add temple\add* ye are.
\p
\v 18 Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in
this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 
\v 19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written,
He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. 
\v 20 And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are
vain. 
\v 21 Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours; 
\v 22 Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or
things present, or things to come; all are yours; 
\v 23 And ye are Christ’s; and Christ \add is\add* God’s.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards
of the mysteries of God. 
\v 2 Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful. 
\v 3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or
of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self. 
\v 4 For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that
judgeth me is the Lord. 
\v 5 Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both
will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the
counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God. 
\v 6 And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and
\add to\add* Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think 
\add of men\add* above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up
for one against another. 
\v 7 For who maketh thee to differ \add from another?\add* and what hast thou
that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive \add it,\add* why dost
thou glory, as if thou hadst not received \add it? \add*
\v 8 Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us:
and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. 
\v 9 For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were
appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels,
and to men. 
\v 10 We \add are\add* fools for Christ’s sake, but ye \add are\add* wise in
Christ; we \add are\add* weak, but ye \add are\add* strong; ye \add are
\add* honourable, but we \add are\add* despised. 
\v 11 Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked,
and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace; 
\v 12 And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being
persecuted, we suffer it: 
\v 13 Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, 
\add and are\add* the offscouring of all things unto this day. 
\v 14 I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn 
\add you. \add*
\v 15 For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet \add have ye
\add* not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the
gospel. 
\v 16 Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me. 
\v 17 For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son,
and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways
which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church. 
\v 18 Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you. 
\v 19 But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the
speech of them which are puffed up, but the power. 
\v 20 For the kingdom of God \add is\add* not in word, but in power. 
\v 21 What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and 
\add in\add* the spirit of meekness?
\c 5
\p
\v 1 It is reported commonly \add that there is\add* fornication among you,
and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one
should have his father’s wife. 
\v 2 And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done
this deed might be taken away from among you. 
\v 3 For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged
already, as though I were present, \add concerning\add* him that hath so done
this deed, 
\v 4 In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and
my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
\v 5 To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that
the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 
\v 6 Your glorying \add is\add* not good. Know ye not that a little leaven
leaveneth the whole lump? 
\v 7 Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are
unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: 
\v 8 Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the
leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened \add bread
\add* of sincerity and truth. 
\v 9 I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators: 
\v 10 Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the
covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of
the world. 
\v 11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is
called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or
a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. 
\v 12 For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye
judge them that are within? 
\v 13 But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among
yourselves that wicked person.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the
unjust, and not before the saints? 
\v 2 Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world
shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 
\v 3 Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain
to this life? 
\v 4 If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to
judge who are least esteemed in the church. 
\v 5 I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you?
no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? 
\v 6 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. 
\v 7 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law
one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather 
\add suffer yourselves to\add* be defrauded? 
\v 8 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that \add your\add* brethren. 
\v 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be
not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor
effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, 
\v 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 
\v 11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but
ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
\p
\v 12 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all
things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. 
\v 13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both
it and them. Now the body \add is\add* not for fornication, but for the Lord;
and the Lord for the body. 
\v 14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his
own power. 
\v 15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then
take the members of Christ, and make \add them\add* the members of an harlot?
God forbid. 
\v 16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for
two, saith he, shall be one flesh. 
\v 17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. 
\v 18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he
that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. 
\v 19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost 
\add which is\add* in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? 
\v 20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and
in your spirit, which are God’s.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: \add It is
\add* good for a man not to touch a woman. 
\v 2 Nevertheless, \add to avoid\add* fornication, let every man have his own
wife, and let every woman have her own husband. 
\v 3 Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also
the wife unto the husband. 
\v 4 The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise
also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife. 
\v 5 Defraud ye not one the other, except \add it be\add* with consent for a
time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together
again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency. 
\v 6 But I speak this by permission, \add and\add* not of commandment. 
\v 7 For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his
proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.
\p
\v 8 I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they
abide even as I. 
\v 9 But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry
than to burn. 
\v 10 And unto the married I command, \add yet\add* not I, but the Lord, Let
not the wife depart from \add her\add* husband: 
\v 11 But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to 
\add her\add* husband: and let not the husband put away \add his\add* wife. 
\v 12 But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that
believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her
away. 
\v 13 And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be
pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. 
\v 14 For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the
unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children
unclean; but now are they holy. 
\v 15 But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is
not under bondage in such \add cases:\add* but God hath called us to peace. 
\v 16 For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save \add thy
\add* husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save \add thy
\add* wife? 
\v 17 But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every
one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches. 
\v 18 Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.
Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised. 
\v 19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping
of the commandments of God. 
\v 20 Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called. 
\v 21 Art thou called \add being\add* a servant? care not for it: but if thou
mayest be made free, use \add it\add* rather. 
\v 22 For he that is called in the Lord, \add being\add* a servant, is the
Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, \add being\add* free, is
Christ’s servant. 
\v 23 Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men. 
\v 24 Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.
\p
\v 25 Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my
judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful. 
\v 26 I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, 
\add I say,\add* that \add it is\add* good for a man so to be. 
\v 27 Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from
a wife? seek not a wife. 
\v 28 But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she
hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I
spare you. 
\v 29 But this I say, brethren, the time \add is\add* short: it remaineth,
that both they that have wives be as though they had none; 
\v 30 And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as
though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not; 
\v 31 And they that use this world, as not abusing \add it:\add* for the
fashion of this world passeth away. 
\v 32 But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth
for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: 
\v 33 But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how
he may please \add his\add* wife. 
\v 34 There is difference \add also\add* between a wife and a virgin. The
unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both
in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the
world, how she may please \add her\add* husband. 
\v 35 And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon
you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord
without distraction. 
\v 36 But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his
virgin, if she pass the flower of \add her\add* age, and need so require, let
him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry. 
\v 37 Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no
necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart
that he will keep his virgin, doeth well. 
\v 38 So then he that giveth \add her\add* in marriage doeth well; but he that
giveth \add her\add* not in marriage doeth better. 
\v 39 The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her
husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the
Lord. 
\v 40 But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also
that I have the Spirit of God.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have
knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. 
\v 2 And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as
he ought to know. 
\v 3 But if any man love God, the same is known of him. 
\v 4 As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in
sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol \add is\add* nothing in the world,
and that \add there is\add* none other God but one. 
\v 5 For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth,
(as there be gods many, and lords many,) 
\v 6 But to us \add there is but\add* one God, the Father, of whom \add are
\add* all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom 
\add are\add* all things, and we by him. 
\v 7 Howbeit \add there is\add* not in every man that knowledge: for some with
conscience of the idol unto this hour eat \add it\add* as a thing offered unto
an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled. 
\v 8 But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the
better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse. 
\v 9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a
stumblingblock to them that are weak. 
\v 10 For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s
temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat
those things which are offered to idols; 
\v 11 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ
died? 
\v 12 But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak
conscience, ye sin against Christ. 
\v 13 Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while
the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our
Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord? 
\v 2 If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the
seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord. 
\v 3 Mine answer to them that do examine me is this, 
\v 4 Have we not power to eat and to drink? 
\v 5 Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other
apostles, and \add as\add* the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas? 
\v 6 Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working? 
\v 7 Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard,
and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of
the milk of the flock? 
\v 8 Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also? 
\v 9 For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of
the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen? 
\v 10 Or saith he \add it\add* altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no
doubt, \add this\add* is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope;
and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. 
\v 11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, \add is it\add* a great thing
if we shall reap your carnal things? 
\v 12 If others be partakers of \add this\add* power over you, \add are
\add* not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all
things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. 
\v 13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live 
\add of the things\add* of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are
partakers with the altar? 
\v 14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should
live of the gospel. 
\v 15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these
things, that it should be so done unto me: for \add it were\add* better for me
to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. 
\v 16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for
necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! 
\v 17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my
will, a dispensation \add of the gospel\add* is committed unto me. 
\v 18 What is my reward then? \add Verily\add* that, when I preach the gospel,
I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in
the gospel. 
\v 19 For though I be free from all \add men,\add* yet have I made myself
servant unto all, that I might gain the more. 
\v 20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them
that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are
under the law; 
\v 21 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to
God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without
law. 
\v 22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all
things to all \add men,\add* that I might by all means save some. 
\v 23 And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker thereof
with \add you. \add*
\v 24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the
prize? So run, that ye may obtain. 
\v 25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.
Now they \add do it\add* to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an
incorruptible. 
\v 26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that
beateth the air: 
\v 27 But I keep under my body, and bring \add it\add* into subjection: lest
that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a
castaway.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all
our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; 
\v 2 And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea; 
\v 3 And did all eat the same spiritual meat; 
\v 4 And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that
spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ. 
\v 5 But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown
in the wilderness. 
\v 6 Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust
after evil things, as they also lusted. 
\v 7 Neither be ye idolaters, as \add were\add* some of them; as it is
written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 
\v 8 Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in
one day three and twenty thousand. 
\v 9 Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were
destroyed of serpents. 
\v 10 Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of
the destroyer. 
\v 11 Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are
written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 
\v 12 Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. 
\v 13 There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God
\add is\add* faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are
able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be
able to bear \add it.\add*
\p
\v 14 Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry. 
\v 15 I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say. 
\v 16 The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood
of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of
Christ? 
\v 17 For we \add being\add* many are one bread, \add and\add* one body: for
we are all partakers of that one bread. 
\v 18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices
partakers of the altar? 
\v 19 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in
sacrifice to idols is any thing? 
\v 20 But \add I say,\add* that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they
sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have
fellowship with devils. 
\v 21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be
partakers of the Lord’s table, and of the table of devils. 
\v 22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? 
\v 23 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all
things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. 
\v 24 Let no man seek his own, but every man another’s \add wealth. 
\add*
\v 25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, \add that\add* eat, asking no
question for conscience sake: 
\v 26 For the earth \add is\add* the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof. 
\v 27 If any of them that believe not bid you \add to a feast,\add* and ye be
disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for
conscience sake. 
\v 28 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols,
eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth 
\add is\add* the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof: 
\v 29 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my
liberty judged of another \add man’s\add* conscience? 
\v 30 For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for
which I give thanks? 
\v 31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the
glory of God. 
\v 32 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the
church of God: 
\v 33 Even as I please all \add men\add* in all \add things,\add* not seeking
mine own profit, but the \add profit\add* of many, that they may be saved.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also \add am\add* of Christ.
\p
\v 2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep
the ordinances, as I delivered \add them\add* to you. 
\v 3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the
head of the woman \add is\add* the man; and the head of Christ \add is
\add* God. 
\v 4 Every man praying or prophesying, having \add his\add* head covered,
dishonoureth his head. 
\v 5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with \add her\add* head
uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were
shaven. 
\v 6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a
shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered. 
\v 7 For a man indeed ought not to cover \add his\add* head, forasmuch as he
is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. 
\v 8 For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man. 
\v 9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man. 
\v 10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on \add her\add* head
because of the angels. 
\v 11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman
without the man, in the Lord. 
\v 12 For as the woman \add is\add* of the man, even so \add is\add* the man
also by the woman; but all things of God. 
\v 13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
\v 14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it
is a shame unto him? 
\v 15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for \add her
\add* hair is given her for a covering. 
\v 16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither
the churches of God.
\p
\v 17 Now in this that I declare \add unto you\add* I praise \add you
\add* not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse. 
\v 18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there
be divisions among you; and I partly believe it. 
\v 19 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved
may be made manifest among you. 
\v 20 When ye come together therefore into one place, \add this\add* is not to
eat the Lord’s supper. 
\v 21 For in eating every one taketh before \add other\add* his own supper:
and one is hungry, and another is drunken. 
\v 22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the
church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I
praise you in this? I praise \add you\add* not. 
\v 23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you,
That the Lord Jesus the \add same\add* night in which he was betrayed took
bread: 
\v 24 And when he had given thanks, he brake \add it,\add* and said, 
\wj Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in
remembrance of me. \wj*
\v 25 After the same manner also \add he took\add* the cup, when he had
supped, saying, \wj This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as
oft as ye drink \add it,\add*\wj*\wj  in remembrance of me. \wj*
\v 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink \add this\add* cup, ye do
shew the Lord’s death till he come. 
\v 27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the
Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. 
\v 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of \add that
\add* bread, and drink of \add that\add* cup. 
\v 29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. 
\v 30 For this cause many \add are\add* weak and sickly among you, and many
sleep. 
\v 31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. 
\v 32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not
be condemned with the world. 
\v 33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for
another. 
\v 34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together
unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Now concerning spiritual \add gifts,\add* brethren, I would not have you
ignorant. 
\v 2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even
as ye were led. 
\v 3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of
God calleth Jesus accursed: and \add that\add* no man can say that Jesus is
the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. 
\v 4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 
\v 5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord. 
\v 6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which
worketh all in all. 
\v 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit
withal. 
\v 8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word
of knowledge by the same Spirit; 
\v 9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by
the same Spirit; 
\v 10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another
discerning of spirits; to another \add divers\add* kinds of tongues; to
another the interpretation of tongues: 
\v 11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to
every man severally as he will. 
\v 12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of
that one body, being many, are one body: so also \add is\add* Christ. 
\v 13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether \add we be
\add* Jews or Gentiles, whether \add we be\add* bond or free; and have been
all made to drink into one Spirit. 
\v 14 For the body is not one member, but many. 
\v 15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body;
is it therefore not of the body? 
\v 16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the
body; is it therefore not of the body? 
\v 17 If the whole body \add were\add* an eye, where \add were\add* the
hearing? If the whole \add were\add* hearing, where \add were\add* the
smelling? 
\v 18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it
hath pleased him. 
\v 19 And if they were all one member, where \add were\add* the body? 
\v 20 But now \add are they\add* many members, yet but one body. 
\v 21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again
the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 
\v 22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble,
are necessary: 
\v 23 And those \add members\add* of the body, which we think to be less
honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely 
\add parts\add* have more abundant comeliness. 
\v 24 For our comely \add parts\add* have no need: but God hath tempered the
body together, having given more abundant honour to that \add part\add* which
lacked: 
\v 25 That there should be no schism in the body; but \add that\add* the
members should have the same care one for another. 
\v 26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one
member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. 
\v 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. 
\v 28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily
prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings,
helps, governments, diversities of tongues. 
\v 29 \add Are\add* all apostles? \add are\add* all prophets? \add are
\add* all teachers? \add are\add* all workers of miracles? 
\v 30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all
interpret? 
\v 31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more
excellent way.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not
charity, I am become \add as \add*sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. 
\v 2 And though I have \add the gift of\add* prophecy, and understand all
mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could
remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 
\v 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed \add the poor,\add* and though I
give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing. 
\v 4 Charity suffereth long, \add and\add* is kind; charity envieth not;
charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 
\v 5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
provoked, thinketh no evil; 
\v 6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; 
\v 7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all
things. 
\v 8 Charity never faileth: but whether \add there be\add* prophecies, they
shall fail; whether \add there be\add* tongues, they shall cease; whether 
\add there be\add* knowledge, it shall vanish away. 
\v 9 For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. 
\v 10 But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall
be done away. 
\v 11 When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I
thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 
\v 12 For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I
know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. 
\v 13 And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of
these \add is\add* charity.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Follow after charity, and desire spiritual \add gifts,\add* but rather
that ye may prophesy. 
\v 2 For he that speaketh in an \add unknown\add* tongue speaketh not unto
men, but unto God: for no man understandeth \add him;\add* howbeit in the
spirit he speaketh mysteries. 
\v 3 But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men \add to\add* edification, and
exhortation, and comfort. 
\v 4 He that speaketh in an \add unknown\add* tongue edifieth himself; but he
that prophesieth edifieth the church. 
\v 5 I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied:
for greater \add is\add* he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with
tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying. 
\v 6 Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I
profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge,
or by prophesying, or by doctrine? 
\v 7 And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except
they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or
harped? 
\v 8 For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to
the battle? 
\v 9 So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be
understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the
air. 
\v 10 There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of
them \add is\add* without signification. 
\v 11 Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him
that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh \add shall be\add* a barbarian
unto me. 
\v 12 Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual \add gifts,
\add* seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. 
\v 13 Wherefore let him that speaketh in an \add unknown\add* tongue pray that
he may interpret. 
\v 14 For if I pray in an \add unknown\add* tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
understanding is unfruitful. 
\v 15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the
understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the
understanding also. 
\v 16 Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth
the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he
understandeth not what thou sayest? 
\v 17 For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. 
\v 18 I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all: 
\v 19 Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding,
that \add by my voice\add* I might teach others also, than ten thousand words
in an \add unknown\add* tongue. 
\v 20 Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye
children, but in understanding be men. 
\v 21 In the law it is written, With \add men of\add* other tongues and other
lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear
me, saith the Lord. 
\v 22 Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them
that believe not: but prophesying \add serveth\add* not for them that believe
not, but for them which believe. 
\v 23 If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all
speak with tongues, and there come in \add those that are\add* unlearned, or
unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad? 
\v 24 But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or 
\add one\add* unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: 
\v 25 And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down
on \add his\add* face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a
truth. 
\v 26 How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a
psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an
interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying. 
\v 27 If any man speak in an \add unknown\add* tongue, \add let it be
\add* by two, or at the most \add by\add* three, and \add that\add* by course;
and let one interpret. 
\v 28 But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and
let him speak to himself, and to God. 
\v 29 Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge. 
\v 30 If \add any thing\add* be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
first hold his peace. 
\v 31 For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be
comforted. 
\v 32 And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 
\v 33 For God is not \add the author\add* of confusion, but of peace, as in
all churches of the saints. 
\v 34 Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted
unto them to speak; but \add they are commanded\add* to be under obedience, as
also saith the law. 
\v 35 And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home:
for it is a shame for women to speak in the church. 
\v 36 What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only? 
\v 37 If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him
acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the
Lord. 
\v 38 But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant. 
\v 39 Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with
tongues. 
\v 40 Let all things be done decently and in order.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto
you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
\v 2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto
you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
\v 3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how
that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
\v 4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to
the scriptures: 
\v 5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve: 
\v 6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom
the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep. 
\v 7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles. 
\v 8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time. 
\v 9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an
apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
\v 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace \add which was
bestowed\add* upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than
they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. 
\v 11 Therefore whether \add it were\add* I or they, so we preach, and so ye
believed. 
\v 12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among
you that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
\v 13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: 
\v 14 And if Christ be not risen, then \add is\add* our preaching vain, and
your faith \add is\add* also vain. 
\v 15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified
of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead
rise not. 
\v 16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 
\v 17 And if Christ be not raised, your faith \add is\add* vain; ye are yet in
your sins. 
\v 18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. 
\v 19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most
miserable. 
\v 20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, \add and\add* become the
firstfruits of them that slept. 
\v 21 For since by man \add came\add* death, by man \add came\add* also the
resurrection of the dead. 
\v 22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 
\v 23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they
that are Christ’s at his coming. 
\v 24 Then \add cometh\add* the end, when he shall have delivered up the
kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all
authority and power. 
\v 25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. 
\v 26 The last enemy \add that\add* shall be destroyed \add is\add* death. 
\v 27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things
are put under \add him, it is\add* manifest that he is excepted, which did put
all things under him. 
\v 28 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also
himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all
in all. 
\v 29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead
rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? 
\v 30 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour? 
\v 31 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die
daily. 
\v 32 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what
advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow
we die. 
\v 33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners. 
\v 34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of
God: I speak \add this\add* to your shame.
\p
\v 35 But some \add man\add* will say, How are the dead raised up? and with
what body do they come? 
\v 36 \add Thou\add* fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it
die: 
\v 37 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but
bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other \add grain: \add*
\v 38 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his
own body. 
\v 39 All flesh \add is\add* not the same flesh: but \add there is\add* one 
\add kind of\add* flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, 
\add and\add* another of birds. 
\v 40 \add There are\add* also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but
the glory of the celestial \add is\add* one, and the \add glory\add* of the
terrestrial \add is\add* another. 
\v 41 \add There is\add* one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
and another glory of the stars: for \add one\add* star differeth from 
\add another\add* star in glory. 
\v 42 So also \add is\add* the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 
\v 43 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness;
it is raised in power: 
\v 44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a
natural body, and there is a spiritual body. 
\v 45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the
last Adam \add was made\add* a quickening spirit. 
\v 46 Howbeit that \add was\add* not first which is spiritual, but that which
is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. 
\v 47 The first man \add is\add* of the earth, earthy: the second man 
\add is\add* the Lord from heaven. 
\v 48 As \add is\add* the earthy, such \add are\add* they also that are
earthy: and as \add is\add* the heavenly, such \add are\add* they also that
are heavenly. 
\v 49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the
image of the heavenly. 
\v 50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. 
\v 51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all
be changed, 
\v 52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall
be changed. 
\v 53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal 
\add must\add* put on immortality. 
\v 54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal
shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that
is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 
\v 55 O death, where \add is\add* thy sting? O grave, where \add is
\add* thy victory? 
\v 56 The sting of death \add is\add* sin; and the strength of sin \add is
\add* the law. 
\v 57 But thanks \add be\add* to God, which giveth us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmovable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is
not in vain in the Lord.

\v 1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to
the churches of Galatia, even so do ye. 
\v 2 Upon the first \add day\add* of the week let every one of you lay by him
in store, as \add God\add* hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings
when I come. 
\v 3 And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by \add your\add* letters,
them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem. 
\v 4 And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me. 
\v 5 Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do
pass through Macedonia. 
\v 6 And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may
bring me on my journey whithersoever I go. 
\v 7 For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with
you, if the Lord permit. 
\v 8 But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. 
\v 9 For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and \add there are
\add* many adversaries. 
\v 10 Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he
worketh the work of the Lord, as I also \add do. \add*
\v 11 Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that
he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren. 
\v 12 As touching \add our\add* brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come
unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time;
but he will come when he shall have convenient time. 
\v 13 Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong. 
\v 14 Let all your things be done with charity. 
\v 15 I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the
firstfruits of Achaia, and \add that\add* they have addicted themselves to the
ministry of the saints,) 
\v 16 That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with
\add us,\add* and laboureth. 
\v 17 I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for
that which was lacking on your part they have supplied. 
\v 18 For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye
them that are such.
\p
\v 19 The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in
the Lord, with the church that is in their house. 
\v 20 All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss. 
\v 21 The salutation of \add me\add* Paul with mine own hand. 
\v 22 If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema
Maranatha. 
\v 23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you. 
\v 24 My love \add be\add* with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
