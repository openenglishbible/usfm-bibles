\h 1 Peter
\mt The First Epistle General of Peter 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout
Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
\v 2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through
sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.
\p
\v 3 Blessed \add be\add* the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by
the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
\v 4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away,
reserved in heaven for you, 
\v 5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be
revealed in the last time. 
\v 6 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are
in heaviness through manifold temptations: 
\v 7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that
perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour
and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 
\v 8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see \add him
\add* not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory: 
\v 9 Receiving the end of your faith, \add even\add* the salvation of 
\add your\add* souls. 
\v 10 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently,
who prophesied of the grace \add that should come\add* unto you: 
\v 11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in
them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and
the glory that should follow. 
\v 12 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they
did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have
preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which
things the angels desire to look into. 
\v 13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end
for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus
Christ; 
\v 14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former
lusts in your ignorance: 
\v 15 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of
conversation; 
\v 16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. 
\v 17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth
according to every man’s work, pass the time of your sojourning \add here
\add* in fear: 
\v 18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things,
\add as\add* silver and gold, from your vain conversation \add received
\add* by tradition from your fathers; 
\v 19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and
without spot: 
\v 20 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was
manifest in these last times for you, 
\v 21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave
him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 
\v 22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the
Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, \add see that ye\add* love one
another with a pure heart fervently: 
\v 23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the
word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. 
\v 24 For all flesh \add is\add* as grass, and all the glory of man as the
flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: 
\v 25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which
by the gospel is preached unto you.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and
envies, and all evil speakings, 
\v 2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow
thereby: 
\v 3 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord \add is\add* gracious. 
\v 4 To whom coming, \add as unto\add* a living stone, disallowed indeed of
men, but chosen of God, \add and\add* precious, 
\v 5 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy
priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus
Christ. 
\v 6 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a
chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be
confounded. 
\v 7 Unto you therefore which believe \add he is\add* precious: but unto them
which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is
made the head of the corner, 
\v 8 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, \add even to them
\add* which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were
appointed. 
\v 9 But ye \add are\add* a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who
hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 
\v 10 Which in time past \add were\add* not a people, but \add are\add* now
the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
\p
\v 11 Dearly beloved, I beseech \add you\add* as strangers and pilgrims,
abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 
\v 12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they
speak against you as evildoers, they may by \add your\add* good works, which
they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
\p
\v 13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether
it be to the king, as supreme; 
\v 14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment
of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well. 
\v 15 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence
the ignorance of foolish men: 
\v 16 As free, and not using \add your\add* liberty for a cloke of
maliciousness, but as the servants of God. 
\v 17 Honour all \add men.\add* Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
king. 
\v 18 Servants, \add be\add* subject to \add your\add* masters with all fear;
not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. 
\v 19 For this \add is\add* thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
endure grief, suffering wrongfully. 
\v 20 For what glory \add is it,\add* if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,
ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer \add for it,
\add* ye take it patiently, this \add is\add* acceptable with God. 
\v 21 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us,
leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps: 
\v 22 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 
\v 23 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he
threatened not; but committed \add himself\add* to him that judgeth
righteously: 
\v 24 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we,
being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were
healed. 
\v 25 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Likewise, ye wives, \add be\add* in subjection to your own husbands;
that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the
conversation of the wives; 
\v 2 While they behold your chaste conversation \add coupled\add* with fear. 
\v 3 Whose adorning let it not be that outward \add adorning\add* of plaiting
the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; 
\v 4 But \add let it be\add* the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not
corruptible, \add even the ornament\add* of a meek and quiet spirit, which is
in the sight of God of great price. 
\v 5 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in
God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: 
\v 6 Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are,
as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. 
\v 7 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with \add them\add* according to knowledge,
giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs
together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. 
\v 8 Finally, \add be ye\add* all of one mind, having compassion one of
another, love as brethren, \add be\add* pitiful, \add be\add* courteous: 
\v 9 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise
blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a
blessing. 
\v 10 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his
tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile: 
\v 11 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it. 
\v 12 For the eyes of the Lord \add are\add* over the righteous, and his ears
\add are open\add* unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord \add is
\add* against them that do evil.
\p
\v 13 And who \add is\add* he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
which is good? 
\v 14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy \add are ye:
\add* and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; 
\v 15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and \add be\add* ready always
to \add give\add* an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope
that is in you with meekness and fear: 
\v 16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of
evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in
Christ. 
\v 17 For \add it is\add* better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
well doing, than for evil doing. 
\v 18 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust,
that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened
by the Spirit: 
\v 19 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison; 
\v 20 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God
waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that
is, eight souls were saved by water. 
\v 21 The like figure whereunto \add even\add* baptism doth also now save us
(not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: 
\v 22 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and
authorities and powers being made subject unto him.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm
yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh
hath ceased from sin; 
\v 2 That he no longer should live the rest of \add his\add* time in the flesh
to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. 
\v 3 For the time past of \add our\add* life may suffice us to have wrought
the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of
wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries: 
\v 4 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with \add them\add* to the
same excess of riot, speaking evil of \add you: \add*
\v 5 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the
dead. 
\v 6 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead,
that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to
God in the spirit.
\p
\v 7 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch
unto prayer. 
\v 8 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity
shall cover the multitude of sins. 
\v 9 Use hospitality one to another without grudging. 
\v 10 As every man hath received the gift, \add even so\add* minister the same
one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. 
\v 11 If any man speak, \add let him speak\add* as the oracles of God; if any
man minister, \add let him do it\add* as of the ability which God giveth: that
God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and
dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 12 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try
you, as though some strange thing happened unto you: 
\v 13 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that,
when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy. 
\v 14 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy \add are ye;
\add* for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is
evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified. 
\v 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or \add as\add* a thief, or 
\add as\add* an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men’s matters. 
\v 16 Yet if \add any man suffer\add* as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
but let him glorify God on this behalf. 
\v 17 For the time \add is come\add* that judgment must begin at the house of
God: and if \add it\add* first \add begin\add* at us, what shall the end 
\add be\add* of them that obey not the gospel of God? 
\v 18 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the
sinner appear? 
\v 19 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the
keeping of their souls \add to him\add* in well doing, as unto a faithful
Creator.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a
witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that
shall be revealed: 
\v 2 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight 
\add thereof,\add* not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but
of a ready mind; 
\v 3 Neither as being lords over \add God’s\add* heritage, but being ensamples
to the flock. 
\v 4 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of
glory that fadeth not away. 
\v 5 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all 
\add of you\add* be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for
God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
\p
\v 6 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may
exalt you in due time: 
\v 7 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you. 
\v 8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 
\v 9 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are
accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. 
\v 10 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by
Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish,
strengthen, settle \add you. \add*
\v 11 To him \add be\add* glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written
briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein
ye stand. 
\v 13 The \add church that is\add* at Babylon, elected together with 
\add you,\add* saluteth you; and \add so doth\add* Marcus my son. 
\v 14 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace \add be\add* with you
all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
