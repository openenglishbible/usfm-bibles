\h Lamentations
\mt The Lamentations of Jeremiah 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 How doth the city sit solitary, \add that was\add* full of people 
\add how\add* is she become as a widow she \add that was\add* great among the
nations, \add and\add* princess among the provinces, \add how\add* is she
become tributary 
\v 2 She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears \add are\add* on her cheeks:
among all her lovers she hath none to comfort \add her:\add* all her friends
have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies. 
\v 3 Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great
servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her
persecutors overtook her between the straits. 
\v 4 The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all
her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she 
\add is\add* in bitterness. 
\v 5 Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath
afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone
into captivity before the enemy. 
\v 6 And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are
become like harts \add that\add* find no pasture, and they are gone without
strength before the pursuer. 
\v 7 Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries
all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell
into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, 
\add and\add* did mock at her sabbaths. 
\v 8 Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that
honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she
sigheth, and turneth backward. 
\v 9 Her filthiness \add is\add* in her skirts; she remembereth not her last
end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold
my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified \add himself. \add*
\v 10 The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for
she hath seen \add that\add* the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou
didst command \add that\add* they should not enter into thy congregation. 
\v 11 All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant
things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am
become vile.
\p
\v 12 \add Is it\add* nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if
there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the
LORD hath afflicted \add me\add* in the day of his fierce anger. 
\v 13 From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against
them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made
me desolate \add and\add* faint all the day. 
\v 14 The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, 
\add and\add* come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord
hath delivered me into \add their\add* hands, \add from whom\add* I am not
able to rise up. 
\v 15 The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty \add men\add* in the
midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the
Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, \add as\add* in a
winepress. 
\v 16 For these \add things\add* I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with
water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my
children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed. 
\v 17 Zion spreadeth forth her hands, \add and there is\add* none to comfort
her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, \add that\add* his adversaries
\add should be\add* round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among
them.
\p
\v 18 The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment:
hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young
men are gone into captivity. 
\v 19 I called for my lovers, \add but\add* they deceived me: my priests and
mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to
relieve their souls. 
\v 20 Behold, O LORD; for I \add am\add* in distress: my bowels are troubled;
mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the
sword bereaveth, at home \add there is\add* as death. 
\v 21 They have heard that I sigh: \add there is\add* none to comfort me: all
mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done 
\add it:\add* thou wilt bring the day \add that\add* thou hast called, and
they shall be like unto me. 
\v 22 Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou
hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs \add are\add* many,
and my heart \add is\add* faint.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger,
\add and\add* cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and
remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger! 
\v 2 The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not
pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of
Judah; he hath brought \add them\add* down to the ground: he hath polluted the
kingdom and the princes thereof. 
\v 3 He hath cut off in \add his\add* fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he
hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against
Jacob like a flaming fire, \add which\add* devoureth round about. 
\v 4 He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an
adversary, and slew all \add that were\add* pleasant to the eye in the
tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire. 
\v 5 The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed
up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in
the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. 
\v 6 And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as \add if it were of
\add* a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath
caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath
despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest. 
\v 7 The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath
given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a
noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast. 
\v 8 The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he
hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying:
therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished
together. 
\v 9 Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her
bars: her king and her princes \add are\add* among the Gentiles: the law 
\add is\add* no \add more;\add* her prophets also find no vision from the
LORD. 
\v 10 The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, \add and
\add* keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded
themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to
the ground. 
\v 11 Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured
upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the
children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. 
\v 12 They say to their mothers, Where \add is\add* corn and wine? when they
swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured
out into their mothers’ bosom. 
\v 13 What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to
thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort
thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can
heal thee? 
\v 14 Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have
not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for
thee false burdens and causes of banishment. 
\v 15 All that pass by clap \add their\add* hands at thee; they hiss and wag
their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, \add saying, Is\add* this the city
that \add men\add* call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
\v 16 All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and
gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed \add her\add* up: certainly this
\add is\add* the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen 
\add it. \add*
\v 17 The LORD hath done \add that\add* which he had devised; he hath
fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown
down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused \add thine\add* enemy to rejoice
over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries. 
\v 18 Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let
tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the
apple of thine eye cease. 
\v 19 Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out
thine heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward
him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of
every street.
\p
\v 20 Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the
women eat their fruit, \add and\add* children of a span long? shall the priest
and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? 
\v 21 The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and
my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain \add them\add* in the
day of thine anger; thou hast killed, \add and\add* not pitied. 
\v 22 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in
the day of the LORD’S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have
swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 I \add am\add* the man \add that\add* hath seen affliction by the rod of
his wrath. 
\v 2 He hath led me, and brought \add me into\add* darkness, but not 
\add into\add* light. 
\v 3 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand \add against me
\add* all the day. 
\v 4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. 
\v 5 He hath builded against me, and compassed \add me\add* with gall and
travail. 
\v 6 He hath set me in dark places, as \add they that be\add* dead of old. 
\v 7 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain
heavy. 
\v 8 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. 
\v 9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
\v 10 He \add was\add* unto me \add as\add* a bear lying in wait, \add and as
\add* a lion in secret places. 
\v 11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me
desolate. 
\v 12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. 
\v 13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. 
\v 14 I was a derision to all my people; \add and\add* their song all the
day. 
\v 15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with
wormwood. 
\v 16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with
ashes. 
\v 17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. 
\v 18 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: 
\v 19 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. 
\v 20 My soul hath \add them\add* still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
\v 21 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
\p
\v 22 \add It is of\add* the LORD’S mercies that we are not consumed, because
his compassions fail not. 
\v 23 \add They are\add* new every morning: great \add is\add* thy
faithfulness. 
\v 24 The LORD \add is\add* my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope
in him. 
\v 25 The LORD \add is\add* good unto them that wait for him, to the soul 
\add that\add* seeketh him. 
\v 26 \add It is\add* good that \add a man\add* should both hope and quietly
wait for the salvation of the LORD. 
\v 27 \add It is\add* good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 
\v 28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon
him. 
\v 29 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. 
\v 30 He giveth \add his\add* cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full
with reproach. 
\v 31 For the Lord will not cast off for ever: 
\v 32 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the
multitude of his mercies. 
\v 33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. 
\v 34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, 
\v 35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, 
\v 36 To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not. 
\v 37 Who \add is\add* he \add that\add* saith, and it cometh to pass, 
\add when\add* the Lord commandeth \add it\add* not? 
\v 38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? 
\v 39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his
sins? 
\v 40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. 
\v 41 Let us lift up our heart with \add our\add* hands unto God in the
heavens. 
\v 42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. 
\v 43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou
hast not pitied. 
\v 44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that \add our\add* prayer should
not pass through. 
\v 45 Thou hast made us \add as\add* the offscouring and refuse in the midst
of the people. 
\v 46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 
\v 47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. 
\v 48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the
daughter of my people. 
\v 49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, 
\v 50 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. 
\v 51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. 
\v 52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. 
\v 53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. 
\v 54 Waters flowed over mine head; \add then\add* I said, I am cut off. 
\v 55 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. 
\v 56 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my
cry. 
\v 57 Thou drewest near in the day \add that\add* I called upon thee: thou
saidst, Fear not. 
\v 58 O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my
life. 
\v 59 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. 
\v 60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance \add and\add* all their imaginations
against me. 
\v 61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, \add and\add* all their
imaginations against me; 
\v 62 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me
all the day. 
\v 63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I \add am\add* their
musick.
\p
\v 64 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their
hands. 
\v 65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. 
\v 66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.

\v 1 How is the gold become dim! \add how\add* is the most fine gold changed!
the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. 
\v 2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed
as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! 
\v 3 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young
ones: the daughter of my people \add is become\add* cruel, like the ostriches
in the wilderness. 
\v 4 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for
thirst: the young children ask bread, \add and\add* no man breaketh 
\add it\add* unto them. 
\v 5 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were
brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. 
\v 6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is
greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a
moment, and no hands stayed on her. 
\v 7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were
more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing \add was\add* of sapphire: 
\v 8 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets:
their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a
stick. 
\v 9 \add They that be\add* slain with the sword are better than \add they
that be\add* slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for 
\add want of\add* the fruits of the field. 
\v 10 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were
their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 
\v 11 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce
anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations
thereof. 
\v 12 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not
have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the
gates of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 13 For the sins of her prophets, \add and\add* the iniquities of her
priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, 
\v 14 They have wandered \add as\add* blind \add men\add* in the streets, they
have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their
garments. 
\v 15 They cried unto them, Depart ye; \add it is\add* unclean; depart,
depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the
heathen, They shall no more sojourn \add there. \add*
\v 16 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them:
they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. 
\v 17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we
have watched for a nation \add that\add* could not save \add us. \add*
\v 18 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near,
our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. 
\v 19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued
us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. 
\v 20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their
pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
\p
\v 21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of
Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and
shalt make thyself naked.
\p
\v 22 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he
will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O
daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Remember, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our
reproach. 
\v 2 Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens. 
\v 3 We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers \add are\add* as widows. 
\v 4 We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us. 
\v 5 Our necks \add are\add* under persecution: we labour, \add and
\add* have no rest. 
\v 6 We have given the hand \add to\add* the Egyptians, \add and to
\add* the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread. 
\v 7 Our fathers have sinned, \add and are\add* not; and we have borne their
iniquities. 
\v 8 Servants have ruled over us: \add there is\add* none that doth deliver 
\add us\add* out of their hand. 
\v 9 We gat our bread with \add the peril of\add* our lives because of the
sword of the wilderness. 
\v 10 Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine. 
\v 11 They ravished the women in Zion, \add and\add* the maids in the cities
of Judah. 
\v 12 Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not
honoured. 
\v 13 They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
\v 14 The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick. 
\v 15 The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning. 
\v 16 The crown is fallen \add from\add* our head: woe unto us, that we have
sinned! 
\v 17 For this our heart is faint; for these \add things\add* our eyes are
dim. 
\v 18 Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon
it. 
\v 19 Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to
generation. 
\v 20 Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, \add and\add* forsake us so long
time? 
\v 21 Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days
as of old. 
\v 22 But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
