\h Jeremiah
\mt The Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that \add were
\add* in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: 
\v 2 To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon
king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 
\v 3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah,
unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah,
unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. 
\v 4 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
\v 5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest
forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, \add and\add* I ordained thee a
prophet unto the nations. 
\v 6 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I \add am
\add* a child.
\p
\v 7 But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I \add am\add* a child: for thou
shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou
shalt speak. 
\v 8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I \add am\add* with thee to deliver
thee, saith the LORD. 
\v 9 Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said
unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. 
\v 10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to
root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and
to plant.
\p
\v 11 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest
thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree. 
\v 12 Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my
word to perform it. 
\v 13 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What
seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof \add is
\add* toward the north. 
\v 14 Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth
upon all the inhabitants of the land. 
\v 15 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,
saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne
at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof
round about, and against all the cities of Judah. 
\v 16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and
worshipped the works of their own hands.
\p
\v 17 Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all
that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee
before them. 
\v 18 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron
pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah,
against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the
people of the land. 
\v 19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against
thee; for I \add am\add* with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
\v 2 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I
remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when
thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land \add that was\add* not
sown. 
\v 3 Israel \add was\add* holiness unto the LORD, \add and\add* the
firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come
upon them, saith the LORD. 
\v 4 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of
the house of Israel:
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that
they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?
\v 6 Neither said they, Where \add is\add* the LORD that brought us up out of
the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of
deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death,
through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt? 
\v 7 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and
the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine
heritage an abomination. 
\v 8 The priests said not, Where \add is\add* the LORD? and they that handle
the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the
prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after \add things that\add* do not
profit.
\p
\v 9 Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your
children’s children will I plead. 
\v 10 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and
consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing. 
\v 11 Hath a nation changed \add their\add* gods, which \add are\add* yet no
gods? but my people have changed their glory for \add that which\add* doth not
profit. 
\v 12 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very
desolate, saith the LORD. 
\v 13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the
fountain of living waters, \add and\add* hewed them out cisterns, broken
cisterns, that can hold no water.
\p
\v 14 \add Is\add* Israel a servant? \add is\add* he a homeborn \add slave?
\add* why is he spoiled? 
\v 15 The young lions roared upon him, \add and\add* yelled, and they made his
land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant. 
\v 16 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy
head. 
\v 17 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the
LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way? 
\v 18 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of
Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of
the river? 
\v 19 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall
reprove thee: know therefore and see that \add it is\add* an evil \add thing
\add* and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear 
\add is\add* not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.
\p
\v 20 For of old time I have broken thy yoke, \add and\add* burst thy bands;
and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under
every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot. 
\v 21 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art
thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me? 
\v 22 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much sope, 
\add yet\add* thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD. 
\v 23 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see
thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: \add thou art\add* a swift
dromedary traversing her ways; 
\v 24 A wild ass used to the wilderness, \add that\add* snuffeth up the wind
at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her
will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her. 
\v 25 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but
thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them
will I go. 
\v 26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel
ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their
prophets, 
\v 27 Saying to a stock, Thou \add art\add* my father; and to a stone, Thou
hast brought me forth: for they have turned \add their\add* back unto me, and
not \add their\add* face: but in the time of their trouble they will say,
Arise, and save us. 
\v 28 But where \add are\add* thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them
arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for \add according
to\add* the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. 
\v 29 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me,
saith the LORD. 
\v 30 In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your
own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
\p
\v 31 O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness unto
Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will
come no more unto thee? 
\v 32 Can a maid forget her ornaments, \add or\add* a bride her attire? yet my
people have forgotten me days without number. 
\v 33 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught
the wicked ones thy ways. 
\v 34 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these. 
\v 35 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from
me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned. 
\v 36 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be
ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. 
\v 37 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for
the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become
another man’s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly
polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again
to me, saith the LORD. 
\v 2 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been
lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the
wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy
wickedness. 
\v 3 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter
rain; and thou hadst a whore’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. 
\v 4 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide
of my youth? 
\v 5 Will he reserve \add his anger\add* for ever? will he keep \add it
\add* to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou
couldest.
\p
\v 6 The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen
\add that\add* which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every
high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot. 
\v 7 And I said after she had done all these \add things,\add* Turn thou unto
me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw \add it. 
\add*
\v 8 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed
adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her
treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also. 
\v 9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she
defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks. 
\v 10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto
me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD. 
\v 11 And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself
more than treacherous Judah.
\p
\v 12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou
backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; \add and\add* I will not cause mine anger
to fall upon you: for I \add am\add* merciful, saith the LORD, \add and
\add* I will not keep \add anger\add* for ever. 
\v 13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the
LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green
tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD. 
\v 14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto you:
and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you
to Zion: 
\v 15 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed
you with knowledge and understanding. 
\v 16 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in the
land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the
covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they
remember it; neither shall they visit \add it;\add* neither shall \add that
\add* be done any more. 
\v 17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all
the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem:
neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart. 
\v 18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel,
and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I
have given for an inheritance unto your fathers. 
\v 19 But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a
pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou
shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.
\p
\v 20 Surely \add as\add* a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so
have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD. 
\v 21 A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping \add and\add*
supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, 
\add and\add* they have forgotten the LORD their God. 
\v 22 Return, ye backsliding children, \add and\add* I will heal your
backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou \add art\add* the LORD our
God. 
\v 23 Truly in vain \add is salvation hoped for\add* from the hills, 
\add and from\add* the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God 
\add is\add* the salvation of Israel. 
\v 24 For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth; their
flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. 
\v 25 We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have
sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto
this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return unto me: and if
thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not
remove. 
\v 2 And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in
righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall
they glory.
\p
\v 3 For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your
fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. 
\v 4 Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your
heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth
like fire, and burn that none can quench \add it,\add* because of the evil of
your doings. 
\v 5 Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the
trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and
let us go into the defenced cities. 
\v 6 Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil
from the north, and a great destruction. 
\v 7 The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles
is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; 
\add and\add* thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant. 
\v 8 For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger
of the LORD is not turned back from us. 
\v 9 And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, \add that
\add* the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and
the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder. 
\v 10 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people
and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto
the soul. 
\v 11 At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry
wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people,
not to fan, nor to cleanse, 
\v 12 \add Even \add*a full wind from those \add places \add*shall come unto
me: now also will I give sentence against them. 
\v 13 Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots \add shall be
\add* as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we
are spoiled. 
\v 14 O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be
saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? 
\v 15 For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount
Ephraim. 
\v 16 Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, 
\add that\add* watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice
against the cities of Judah. 
\v 17 As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because she
hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD. 
\v 18 Thy way and thy doings have procured these \add things\add* unto thee;
this \add is\add* thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth
unto thine heart.
\p
\v 19 My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a
noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the
sound of the trump, the alarm of war. 
\v 20 Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is spoiled:
suddenly are my tents spoiled, \add and\add* my curtains in a moment. 
\v 21 How long shall I see the standard, \add and\add* hear the sound of the
trumpet? 
\v 22 For my people \add is\add* foolish, they have not known me; they 
\add are\add* sottish children, and they have none understanding: they 
\add are\add* wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. 
\v 23 I beheld the earth, and, lo, \add it was\add* without form, and void;
and the heavens, and they \add had\add* no light. 
\v 24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved
lightly. 
\v 25 I beheld, and, lo, \add there was\add* no man, and all the birds of the
heavens were fled. 
\v 26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place \add was\add* a wilderness, and
all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, 
\add and\add* by his fierce anger. 
\v 27 For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will
I not make a full end. 
\v 28 For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because
I have spoken \add it,\add* I have purposed \add it,\add* and will not repent,
neither will I turn back from it. 
\v 29 The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they
shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city \add shall be
\add* forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. 
\v 30 And \add when\add* thou \add art\add* spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though
thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of
gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make
thyself fair; \add thy\add* lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy
life. 
\v 31 For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, \add and\add* the
anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the
daughter of Zion, \add that\add* bewaileth herself, \add that\add* spreadeth
her hands, \add saying,\add* Woe \add is\add* me now! for my soul is wearied
because of murderers.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and
know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be
\add any\add* that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will
pardon it. 
\v 2 And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely. 
\v 3 O LORD, \add are\add* not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken
them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, \add but\add* they
have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a
rock; they have refused to return. 
\v 4 Therefore I said, Surely these \add are\add* poor; they are foolish: for
they know not the way of the LORD, \add nor\add* the judgment of their God. 
\v 5 I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have
known the way of the LORD, \add and\add* the judgment of their God: but these
have altogether broken the yoke, \add and\add* burst the bonds. 
\v 6 Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, \add and\add* a wolf
of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities:
every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their
transgressions are many, \add and\add* their backslidings are increased.
\p
\v 7 How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and
sworn by \add them that are\add* no gods: when I had fed them to the full,
they then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the
harlots’ houses. 
\v 8 They were \add as\add* fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after
his neighbour’s wife. 
\v 9 Shall I not visit for these \add things?\add* saith the LORD: and shall
not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\p
\v 10 Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away
her battlements; for they \add are\add* not the LORD’S. 
\v 11 For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very
treacherously against me, saith the LORD. 
\v 12 They have belied the LORD, and said, \add It is\add* not he; neither
shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: 
\v 13 And the prophets shall become wind, and the word \add is\add* not in
them: thus shall it be done unto them. 
\v 14 Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word,
behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it
shall devour them. 
\v 15 Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith
the LORD: it \add is\add* a mighty nation, it \add is\add* an ancient nation,
a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they
say. 
\v 16 Their quiver \add is\add* as an open sepulchre, they \add are
\add* all mighty men. 
\v 17 And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, \add which
\add* thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and
thine herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall
impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword. 
\v 18 Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end
with you.
\p
\v 19 And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the LORD
our God all these \add things\add* unto us? then shalt thou answer them, Like
as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye
serve strangers in a land \add that is\add* not yours. 
\v 20 Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, 
\v 21 Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which have
eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not: 
\v 22 Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence,
which have placed the sand \add for\add* the bound of the sea by a perpetual
decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves,
yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it? 
\v 23 But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are
revolted and gone. 
\v 24 Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that
giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserveth unto
us the appointed weeks of the harvest.
\p
\v 25 Your iniquities have turned away these \add things,\add* and your sins
have withholden good \add things\add* from you. 
\v 26 For among my people are found wicked \add men:\add* they lay wait, as he
that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. 
\v 27 As a cage is full of birds, so \add are\add* their houses full of
deceit: therefore they are become great, and waxen rich. 
\v 28 They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the
wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they
prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. 
\v 29 Shall I not visit for these \add things?\add* saith the LORD: shall not
my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?
\p
\v 30 A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; 
\v 31 The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means;
and my people love \add to have it\add* so: and what will ye do in the end
thereof?
\c 6
\p
\v 1 O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of
Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in
Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction. 
\v 2 I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate \add woman.
\add*
\v 3 The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch 
\add their\add* tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in
his place. 
\v 4 Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us!
for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out. 
\v 5 Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
\p
\v 6 For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount
against Jerusalem: this \add is\add* the city to be visited; she \add is
\add* wholly oppression in the midst of her. 
\v 7 As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness:
violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and
wounds. 
\v 8 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I
make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
\p
\v 9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant of
Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets. 
\v 10 To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold,
their ear \add is\add* uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the
word of the LORD is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it. 
\v 11 Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in:
I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young
men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with
\add him that is\add* full of days. 
\v 12 And their houses shall be turned unto others, \add with their
\add* fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the
inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD. 
\v 13 For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one 
\add is\add* given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest
every one dealeth falsely. 
\v 14 They have healed also the hurt \add of the daughter\add* of my people
slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when \add there is\add* no peace. 
\v 15 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were
not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among
them that fall: at the time \add that\add* I visit them they shall be cast
down, saith the LORD. 
\v 16 Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old
paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for
your souls. But they said, We will not walk \add therein. \add*
\v 17 Also I set watchmen over you, \add saying,\add* Hearken to the sound of
the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.
\p
\v 18 Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what \add is
\add* among them. 
\v 19 Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, \add even
\add* the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my
words, nor to my law, but rejected it. 
\v 20 To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet
cane from a far country? your burnt offerings \add are\add* not acceptable,
nor your sacrifices sweet unto me. 
\v 21 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks before
this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the
neighbour and his friend shall perish. 
\v 22 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and
a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth. 
\v 23 They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they \add are\add* cruel, and have
no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in
array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion. 
\v 24 We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken
hold of us, \add and\add* pain, as of a woman in travail. 
\v 25 Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the
enemy \add and\add* fear \add is\add* on every side.
\p
\v 26 O daughter of my people, gird \add thee\add* with sackcloth, and wallow
thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, \add as for\add* an only son, most
bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. 
\v 27 I have set thee \add for\add* a tower \add and\add* a fortress among my
people, that thou mayest know and try their way. 
\v 28 They \add are\add* all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: 
\add they are\add* brass and iron; they \add are\add* all corrupters. 
\v 29 The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder
melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. 
\v 30 Reprobate silver shall \add men\add* call them, because the LORD hath
rejected them.

\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
\v 2 Stand in the gate of the LORD’S house, and proclaim there this word, and
say, Hear the word of the LORD, all \add ye of\add* Judah, that enter in at
these gates to worship the LORD. 
\v 3 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your
doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. 
\v 4 Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple
of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, \add are\add* these. 
\v 5 For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly
execute judgment between a man and his neighbour; 
\v 6 \add If\add* ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow,
and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to
your hurt: 
\v 7 Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to
your fathers, for ever and ever.
\p
\v 8 Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. 
\v 9 Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn
incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not; 
\v 10 And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name,
and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations? 
\v 11 Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in
your eyes? Behold, even I have seen \add it,\add* saith the LORD. 
\v 12 But go ye now unto my place which \add was\add* in Shiloh, where I set
my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people
Israel. 
\v 13 And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I
spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called
you, but ye answered not; 
\v 14 Therefore will I do unto \add this\add* house, which is called by my
name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your
fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. 
\v 15 And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
brethren, \add even\add* the whole seed of Ephraim. 
\v 16 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer
for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.
\p
\v 17 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of
Jerusalem? 
\v 18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women
knead \add their\add* dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour
out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. 
\v 19 Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: \add do they\add* not 
\add provoke\add* themselves to the confusion of their own faces? 
\v 20 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall
be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of
the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not
be quenched.
\p
\v 21 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt
offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh. 
\v 22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I
brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or
sacrifices: 
\v 23 But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be
your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have
commanded you, that it may be well unto you. 
\v 24 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the
counsels \add and\add* in the imagination of their evil heart, and went
backward, and not forward. 
\v 25 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto
this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising
up early and sending \add them: \add*
\v 26 Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened
their neck: they did worse than their fathers. 
\v 27 Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not
hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer
thee. 
\v 28 But thou shalt say unto them, This \add is\add* a nation that obeyeth
not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is
perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
\p
\v 29 Cut off thine hair, \add O Jerusalem,\add* and cast \add it\add* away,
and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and
forsaken the generation of his wrath. 
\v 30 For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD:
they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to
pollute it. 
\v 31 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of
the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I
commanded \add them\add* not, neither came it into my heart.
\p
\v 32 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more
be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of
slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place. 
\v 33 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the
heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray \add them
\add* away. 
\v 34 Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the
streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice
of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be
desolate.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring out the bones of the kings
of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the
bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of
their graves: 
\v 2 And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host
of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom
they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped:
they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the
face of the earth. 
\v 3 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them
that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have
driven them, saith the LORD of hosts.
\p
\v 4 Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall,
and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return? 
\v 5 Why \add then\add* is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a
perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. 
\v 6 I hearkened and heard, \add but\add* they spake not aright: no man
repented him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to
his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle. 
\v 7 Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle
and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people
know not the judgment of the LORD. 
\v 8 How do ye say, We \add are\add* wise, and the law of the LORD \add is
\add* with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he \add it;\add* the pen of the
scribes \add is\add* in vain. 
\v 9 The wise \add men\add* are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they
have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom \add is\add* in them? 
\v 10 Therefore will I give their wives unto others, \add and\add* their
fields to them that shall inherit \add them:\add* for every one from the least
even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto
the priest every one dealeth falsely. 
\v 11 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly,
saying, Peace, peace; when \add there is\add* no peace. 
\v 12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were
not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among
them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith
the LORD.
\p
\v 13 I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: \add there shall be
\add* no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall
fade; and \add the things that\add* I have given them shall pass away from
them. 
\v 14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the
defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us
to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned
against the LORD. 
\v 15 We looked for peace, but no good \add came; and\add* for a time of
health, and behold trouble! 
\v 16 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled
at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have
devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell
therein. 
\v 17 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which 
\add will\add* not \add be\add* charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the
LORD.
\p
\v 18 \add When\add* I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart 
\add is\add* faint in me. 
\v 19 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them
that dwell in a far country: \add Is\add* not the LORD in Zion? \add is
\add* not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their
graven images, \add and\add* with strange vanities? 
\v 20 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. 
\v 21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black;
astonishment hath taken hold on me. 
\v 22 \add Is there\add* no balm in Gilead; \add is there\add* no physician
there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I
might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! 
\v 2 Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men; that I
might leave my people, and go from them! for they \add be\add* all adulterers,
an assembly of treacherous men. 
\v 3 And they bend their tongues \add like\add* their bow \add for\add* lies:
but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from
evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD. 
\v 4 Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother:
for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with
slanders. 
\v 5 And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak the
truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, \add and\add* weary
themselves to commit iniquity. 
\v 6 Thine habitation \add is\add* in the midst of deceit; through deceit they
refuse to know me, saith the LORD. 
\v 7 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try
them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people? 
\v 8 Their tongue \add is as\add* an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: 
\add one\add* speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart
he layeth his wait.
\p
\v 9 Shall I not visit them for these \add things?\add* saith the LORD: shall
not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 
\v 10 For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the
habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so
that none can pass through \add them;\add* neither can \add men\add* hear the
voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they
are gone. 
\v 11 And I will make Jerusalem heaps, \add and\add* a den of dragons; and I
will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
\p
\v 12 Who \add is\add* the wise man, that may understand this? and \add who is
he\add* to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for
what the land perisheth \add and\add* is burned up like a wilderness, that
none passeth through? 
\v 13 And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before
them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein; 
\v 14 But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after
Baalim, which their fathers taught them: 
\v 15 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
will feed them, \add even\add* this people, with wormwood, and give them water
of gall to drink. 
\v 16 I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their
fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed
them.
\p
\v 17 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning
women, that they may come; and send for cunning \add women,\add* that they may
come: 
\v 18 And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may
run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. 
\v 19 For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we are
greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings
have cast \add us\add* out. 
\v 20 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the
word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her
neighbour lamentation. 
\v 21 For death is come up into our windows, \add and\add* is entered into our
palaces, to cut off the children from without, \add and\add* the young men
from the streets. 
\v 22 Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as dung
upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and none shall
gather \add them.\add*
\p
\v 23 Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise \add man\add* glory in his wisdom,
neither let the mighty \add man\add* glory in his might, let not the rich 
\add man\add* glory in his riches: 
\v 24 But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and
knoweth me, that I \add am\add* the LORD which exercise lovingkindness,
judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these \add things
\add* I delight, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 25 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all 
\add them which are\add* circumcised with the uncircumcised; 
\v 26 Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all
\add that are\add* in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for
all \add these\add* nations \add are\add* uncircumcised, and all the house of
Israel \add are\add* uncircumcised in the heart.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel: 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not
dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. 
\v 3 For the customs of the people \add are\add* vain: for \add one
\add* cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman,
with the axe. 
\v 4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and
with hammers, that it move not. 
\v 5 They \add are\add* upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must
needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot
do evil, neither also \add is it\add* in them to do good. 
\v 6 Forasmuch as \add there is\add* none like unto thee, O LORD; thou 
\add art\add* great, and thy name is great in might. 
\v 7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it
appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise \add men\add* of the nations, and
in all their kingdoms, \add there is\add* none like unto thee. 
\v 8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock \add is
\add* a doctrine of vanities. 
\v 9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz,
the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is
their clothing: they \add are\add* all the work of cunning \add men. 
\add*
\v 10 But the LORD \add is\add* the true God, he \add is\add* the living God,
and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations
shall not be able to abide his indignation. 
\v 11 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and
the earth, \add even\add* they shall perish from the earth, and from under
these heavens. 
\v 12 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by
his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. 
\v 13 When he uttereth his voice, \add there is\add* a multitude of waters in
the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;
he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his
treasures. 
\v 14 Every man is brutish in \add his\add* knowledge: every founder is
confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and 
\add there is\add* no breath in them. 
\v 15 They \add are\add* vanity, \add and\add* the work of errors: in the time
of their visitation they shall perish. 
\v 16 The portion of Jacob \add is\add* not like them: for he \add is
\add* the former of all \add things;\add* and Israel \add is\add* the rod of
his inheritance: The LORD of hosts \add is\add* his name.
\p
\v 17 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. 
\v 18 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the
land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find \add it
\add* so.
\p
\v 19 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this 
\add is\add* a grief, and I must bear it. 
\v 20 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are
gone forth of me, and they \add are\add* not: \add there is\add* none to
stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. 
\v 21 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD:
therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered. 
\v 22 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the
north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, \add and\add* a den of
dragons.
\p
\v 23 O LORD, I know that the way of man \add is\add* not in himself: 
\add it is\add* not in man that walketh to direct his steps. 
\v 24 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou
bring me to nothing. 
\v 25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the
families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured
him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
\v 2 Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto the men of Judah, and
to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 
\v 3 And say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed 
\add be\add* the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant, 
\v 4 Which I commanded your fathers in the day \add that\add* I brought them
forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice,
and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people,
and I will be your God: 
\v 5 That I may perform the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, to give
them a land flowing with milk and honey, as \add it is\add* this day. Then
answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD. 
\v 6 Then the LORD said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of
Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this
covenant, and do them. 
\v 7 For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day \add that
\add* I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, \add even\add* unto this
day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice. 
\v 8 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the
imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the
words of this covenant, which I commanded \add them\add* to do; but they did 
\add them\add* not. 
\v 9 And the LORD said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah,
and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 10 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which
refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the
house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made
with their fathers.
\p
\v 11 Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them,
which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I
will not hearken unto them. 
\v 12 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry
unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at
all in the time of their trouble. 
\v 13 For \add according to\add* the number of thy cities were thy gods, O
Judah; and \add according to\add* the number of the streets of Jerusalem have
ye set up altars to \add that\add* shameful thing, \add even\add* altars to
burn incense unto Baal. 
\v 14 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer
for them: for I will not hear \add them\add* in the time that they cry unto me
for their trouble. 
\v 15 What hath my beloved to do in mine house, \add seeing\add* she hath
wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou
doest evil, then thou rejoicest. 
\v 16 The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, \add and\add* of
goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it,
and the branches of it are broken. 
\v 17 For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against
thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which
they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense
unto Baal.
\p
\v 18 And the LORD hath given me knowledge \add of it,\add* and I know 
\add it:\add* then thou shewedst me their doings. 
\v 19 But I \add was\add* like a lamb \add or\add* an ox \add that\add* is
brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against
me, \add saying,\add* Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let
us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more
remembered. 
\v 20 But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins
and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed
my cause. 
\v 21 Therefore thus saith the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy
life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that thou die not by our
hand: 
\v 22 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the
young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by
famine: 
\v 23 And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the
men of Anathoth, \add even\add* the year of their visitation.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Righteous \add art\add* thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me
talk with thee of \add thy\add* judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the
wicked prosper? \add wherefore\add* are all they happy that deal very
treacherously? 
\v 2 Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root: they grow, yea, they
bring forth fruit: thou \add art\add* near in their mouth, and far from their
reins. 
\v 3 But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart
toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for
the day of slaughter. 
\v 4 How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for
the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the
birds; because they said, He shall not see our last end. 
\v 5 If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how
canst thou contend with horses? and \add if\add* in the land of peace, 
\add wherein\add* thou trustedst, \add they wearied thee,\add* then how wilt
thou do in the swelling of Jordan? 
\v 6 For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt
treacherously with thee; yea, they have called a multitude after thee: believe
them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.
\p
\v 7 I have forsaken mine house, I have left mine heritage; I have given the
dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. 
\v 8 Mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against
me: therefore have I hated it. 
\v 9 Mine heritage \add is\add* unto me \add as\add* a speckled bird, the
birds round about \add are\add* against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts
of the field, come to devour. 
\v 10 Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion
under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. 
\v 11 They have made it desolate, \add and being\add* desolate it mourneth
unto me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth \add it
\add* to heart. 
\v 12 The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for
the sword of the LORD shall devour from the \add one\add* end of the land even
to the \add other\add* end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. 
\v 13 They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to
pain, \add but\add* shall not profit: and they shall be ashamed of your
revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
\p
\v 14 Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the
inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will
pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among
them. 
\v 15 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will
return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to
his heritage, and every man to his land. 
\v 16 And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my
people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to
swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people. 
\v 17 But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that
nation, saith the LORD.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the LORD unto me, Go and get thee a linen girdle, and put it
upon thy loins, and put it not in water. 
\v 2 So I got a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put \add it
\add* on my loins. 
\v 3 And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, 
\v 4 Take the girdle that thou hast got, which \add is\add* upon thy loins,
and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. 
\v 5 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me. 
\v 6 And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said unto me, Arise,
go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to
hide there. 
\v 7 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place
where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for
nothing. 
\v 8 Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
\v 9 Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and
the great pride of Jerusalem. 
\v 10 This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the
imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to
worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. 
\v 11 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to
cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith
the LORD; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a
praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
\p
\v 12 Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the LORD God
of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto
thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? 
\v 13 Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill
all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne,
and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with
drunkenness. 
\v 14 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons
together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but
destroy them.
\p
\v 15 Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken. 
\v 16 Give glory to the LORD your God, before he cause darkness, and before
your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he
turn it into the shadow of death, \add and\add* make \add it\add* gross
darkness. 
\v 17 But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for 
\add your\add* pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears,
because the LORD’S flock is carried away captive. 
\v 18 Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for
your principalities shall come down, \add even\add* the crown of your glory. 
\v 19 The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open 
\add them:\add* Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be
wholly carried away captive. 
\v 20 Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where 
\add is\add* the flock \add that\add* was given thee, thy beautiful flock? 
\v 21 What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them
\add to be\add* captains, \add and\add* as chief over thee: shall not sorrows
take thee, as a woman in travail?
\p
\v 22 And if thou say in thine heart, Wherefore come these things upon me? For
the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, \add and
\add* thy heels made bare. 
\v 23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? \add then
\add* may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. 
\v 24 Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the
wind of the wilderness. 
\v 25 This \add is\add* thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith
the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. 
\v 26 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may
appear. 
\v 27 I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy
whoredom, \add and\add* thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe
unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when \add shall it
\add* once \add be?\add*
\c 14
\p
\v 1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth. 
\v 2 Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish; they are black unto the
ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. 
\v 3 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to
the pits, \add and\add* found no water; they returned with their vessels
empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. 
\v 4 Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the
plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. 
\v 5 Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook \add it,\add* because
there was no grass. 
\v 6 And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind
like dragons; their eyes did fail, because \add there was\add* no grass.
\p
\v 7 O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou \add it
\add* for thy name’s sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned
against thee. 
\v 8 O the hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in time of trouble, why
shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a wayfaring man 
\add that\add* turneth aside to tarry for a night? 
\v 9 Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man \add that
\add* cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, \add art\add* in the midst of us, and we
are called by thy name; leave us not.
\p
\v 10 Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Thus have they loved to wander,
they have not refrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them;
he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. 
\v 11 Then said the LORD unto me, Pray not for this people for \add their
\add* good. 
\v 12 When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt
offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by
the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence.
\p
\v 13 Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall
not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured
peace in this place. 
\v 14 Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I
sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake unto them: they
prophesy unto you a false vision and divination, and a thing of nought, and
the deceit of their heart. 
\v 15 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in
my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in
this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed. 
\v 16 And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of
Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to
bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will
pour their wickedness upon them.
\p
\v 17 Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them; Let mine eyes run down
with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of
my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. 
\v 18 If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and
if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yea,
both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not. 
\v 19 Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul lothed Zion? why hast
thou smitten us, and \add there is\add* no healing for us? we looked for
peace, and \add there is\add* no good; and for the time of healing, and behold
trouble! 
\v 20 We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, \add and\add* the iniquity of
our fathers: for we have sinned against thee. 
\v 21 Do not abhor \add us,\add* for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the
throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us. 
\v 22 Are there \add any\add* among the vanities of the Gentiles that can
cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? \add art\add* not thou he, O LORD
our God? therefore we will wait upon thee: for thou hast made all these 
\add things.\add*
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then said the LORD unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, 
\add yet\add* my mind \add could\add* not \add be\add* toward this people:
cast \add them\add* out of my sight, and let them go forth. 
\v 2 And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither shall we go
forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as \add are
\add* for death, to death; and such as \add are\add* for the sword, to the
sword; and such as \add are\add* for the famine, to the famine; and such as 
\add are\add* for the captivity, to the captivity. 
\v 3 And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to
slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the
earth, to devour and destroy. 
\v 4 And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth,
because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for \add that
\add* which he did in Jerusalem. 
\v 5 For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee?
or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest? 
\v 6 Thou hast forsaken me, saith the LORD, thou art gone backward: therefore
will I stretch out my hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with
repenting. 
\v 7 And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave 
\add them\add* of children, I will destroy my people, \add since\add* they
return not from their ways. 
\v 8 Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have
brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I
have caused \add him\add* to fall upon it suddenly, and terrors upon the
city. 
\v 9 She that hath borne seven languisheth: she hath given up the ghost; her
sun is gone down while \add it was\add* yet day: she hath been ashamed and
confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their
enemies, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 10 Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man
of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have
lent to me on usury; \add yet\add* every one of them doth curse me. 
\v 11 The LORD said, Verily it shall be well with thy remnant; verily I will
cause the enemy to entreat thee \add well\add* in the time of evil and in the
time of affliction. 
\v 12 Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel? 
\v 13 Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to the spoil without price,
and \add that\add* for all thy sins, even in all thy borders. 
\v 14 And I will make \add thee\add* to pass with thine enemies into a land 
\add which\add* thou knowest not: for a fire is kindled in mine anger, 
\add which\add* shall burn upon you.
\p
\v 15 O LORD, thou knowest: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my
persecutors; take me not away in thy longsuffering: know that for thy sake I
have suffered rebuke. 
\v 16 Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the
joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for I am called by thy name, O LORD God of
hosts. 
\v 17 I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone
because of thy hand: for thou hast filled me with indignation. 
\v 18 Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, \add which\add*
refuseth to be healed? wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar, \add and as
\add* waters \add that\add* fail?
\p
\v 19 Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou return, then will I bring thee
again, \add and\add* thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take forth the
precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee;
but return not thou unto them. 
\v 20 And I will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall: and they
shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I 
\add am\add* with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD. 
\v 21 And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem
thee out of the hand of the terrible.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying, 
\v 2 Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or
daughters in this place. 
\v 3 For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters
that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and
concerning their fathers that begat them in this land; 
\v 4 They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither
shall they be buried; \add but\add* they shall be as dung upon the face of the
earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their
carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the
earth. 
\v 5 For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go
to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people,
saith the LORD, \add even\add* lovingkindness and mercies. 
\v 6 Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be
buried, neither shall \add men\add* lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor
make themselves bald for them: 
\v 7 Neither shall \add men\add* tear \add themselves\add* for them in
mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall \add men\add* give them
the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. 
\v 8 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to
eat and to drink. 
\v 9 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause
to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth,
and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the
bride.
\p
\v 10 And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these
words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD pronounced all
this great evil against us? or what \add is\add* our iniquity? or what 
\add is\add* our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God? 
\v 11 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me,
saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and
have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law; 
\v 12 And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one
after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me: 
\v 13 Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not,
\add neither\add* ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day
and night; where I will not shew you favour.
\p
\v 14 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more
be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the
land of Egypt; 
\v 15 But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the
land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I
will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.
\p
\v 16 Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall
fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them
from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. 
\v 17 For mine eyes \add are\add* upon all their ways: they are not hid from
my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes. 
\v 18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because
they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases
of their detestable and abominable things. 
\v 19 O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of
affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and
shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and \add things
\add* wherein \add there is\add* no profit. 
\v 20 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they \add are\add* no gods? 
\v 21 Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause
them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name 
\add is\add* The LORD.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 The sin of Judah \add is\add* written with a pen of iron, \add and
\add* with the point of a diamond: \add it is\add* graven upon the table of
their heart, and upon the horns of your altars; 
\v 2 Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green
trees upon the high hills. 
\v 3 O my mountain in the field, I will give thy substance \add and
\add* all thy treasures to the spoil, \add and\add* thy high places for sin,
throughout all thy borders. 
\v 4 And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave
thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou
knowest not: for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger, \add which\add* shall
burn for ever.
\p
\v 5 Thus saith the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh
flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the LORD. 
\v 6 For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good
cometh; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, \add in
\add* a salt land and not inhabited. 
\v 7 Blessed \add is\add* the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope
the LORD is. 
\v 8 For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and \add that
\add* spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat
cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of
drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
\p
\v 9 The heart \add is\add* deceitful above all \add things,\add* and
desperately wicked: who can know it? 
\v 10 I the LORD search the heart, \add I\add* try the reins, even to give
every man according to his ways, \add and\add* according to the fruit of his
doings. 
\v 11 As the partridge sitteth \add on eggs,\add* and hatcheth \add them
\add* not; \add so\add* he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave
them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.
\p
\v 12 A glorious high throne from the beginning \add is\add* the place of our
sanctuary. 
\v 13 O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, 
\add and\add* they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because
they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters. 
\v 14 Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved:
for thou \add art\add* my praise.
\p
\v 15 Behold, they say unto me, Where \add is\add* the word of the LORD? let
it come now. 
\v 16 As for me, I have not hastened from \add being\add* a pastor to follow
thee: neither have I desired the woeful day; thou knowest: that which came out
of my lips was \add right\add* before thee. 
\v 17 Be not a terror unto me: thou \add art\add* my hope in the day of evil.
\v 18 Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded:
let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of
evil, and destroy them with double destruction.
\p
\v 19 Thus said the LORD unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of
the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out,
and in all the gates of Jerusalem; 
\v 20 And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and
all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these
gates: 
\v 21 Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the
sabbath day, nor bring \add it\add* in by the gates of Jerusalem; 
\v 22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day,
neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your
fathers. 
\v 23 But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck
stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. 
\v 24 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the
LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day,
but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; 
\v 25 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes
sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and
their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this
city shall remain for ever. 
\v 26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about
Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the
mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and
meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house
of the LORD. 
\v 27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to
bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day;
then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the
palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
\v 2 Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to
hear my words. 
\v 3 Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he wrought a work on
the wheels. 
\v 4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter:
so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make 
\add it. \add*
\v 5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 
\v 6 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD.
Behold, as the clay \add is\add* in the potter’s hand, so \add are\add* ye in
mine hand, O house of Israel. 
\v 7 \add At what\add* instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy 
\add it; \add*
\v 8 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I
will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. 
\v 9 And \add at what\add* instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and
concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant \add it; \add*
\v 10 If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent
of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.
\p
\v 11 Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you,
and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way,
and make your ways and your doings good. 
\v 12 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices,
and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart. 
\v 13 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath
heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing. 
\v 14 Will \add a man\add* leave the snow of Lebanon \add which cometh
\add* from the rock of the field? \add or\add* shall the cold flowing waters
that come from another place be forsaken? 
\v 15 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity,
and they have caused them to stumble in their ways \add from\add* the ancient
paths, to walk in paths, \add in\add* a way not cast up; 
\v 16 To make their land desolate, \add and\add* a perpetual hissing; every
one that passeth thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head. 
\v 17 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew
them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.
\p
\v 18 Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for
the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the
word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us
not give heed to any of his words. 
\v 19 Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend
with me. 
\v 20 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my
soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, \add and
\add* to turn away thy wrath from them. 
\v 21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their 
\add blood\add* by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of
their children, and \add be\add* widows; and let their men be put to death; 
\add let\add* their young men \add be\add* slain by the sword in battle. 
\v 22 Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop
suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for
my feet. 
\v 23 Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay \add me:
\add* forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight,
but let them be overthrown before thee; deal \add thus\add* with them in the
time of thine anger.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter’s earthen bottle, and 
\add take\add* of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the
priests; 
\v 2 And go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which \add is
\add* by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall
tell thee, 
\v 3 And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants
of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will
bring evil upon this place, the which whosoever heareth, his ears shall
tingle. 
\v 4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have
burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have
known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of
innocents; 
\v 5 They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with
fire \add for\add* burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake
\add it,\add* neither came \add it\add* into my mind: 
\v 6 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall
no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley
of slaughter. 
\v 7 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place;
and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the
hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat
for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. 
\v 8 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that
passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues
thereof. 
\v 9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of
their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the
siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives,
shall straiten them. 
\v 10 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with
thee, 
\v 11 And shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I
break this people and this city, as \add one\add* breaketh a potter’s vessel,
that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury \add them\add* in Tophet,
till \add there be\add* no place to bury. 
\v 12 Thus will I do unto this place, saith the LORD, and to the inhabitants
thereof, and \add even\add* make this city as Tophet: 
\v 13 And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall
be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs
they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven, and have poured out
drink offerings unto other gods. 
\v 14 Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to
prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD’S house; and said to all the
people, 
\v 15 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring
upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced
against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear
my words.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who \add was\add* also chief
governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these
things. 
\v 2 Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that 
\add were\add* in the high gate of Benjamin, which \add was\add* by the house
of the LORD. 
\v 3 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out
of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name
Pashur, but Magor-missabib. 
\v 4 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself,
and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and
thine eyes shall behold \add it:\add* and I will give all Judah into the hand
of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and
shall slay them with the sword. 
\v 5 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the
labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of
the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall
spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. 
\v 6 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into
captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt
be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied
lies.
\p
\v 7 O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than
I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me. 
\v 8 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the
word of the LORD was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily. 
\v 9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his
name. But \add his word\add* was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my
bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not \add stay.\add*
\p
\v 10 For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, 
\add say they,\add* and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my
halting, \add saying,\add* Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall
prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him. 
\v 11 But the LORD \add is\add* with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my
persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly
ashamed; for they shall not prosper: \add their\add* everlasting confusion
shall never be forgotten. 
\v 12 But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, \add and\add* seest the
reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I
opened my cause. 
\v 13 Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul
of the poor from the hand of evildoers.
\p
\v 14 Cursed \add be\add* the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein
my mother bare me be blessed. 
\v 15 Cursed \add be\add* the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A
man child is born unto thee; making him very glad. 
\v 16 And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented
not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noontide; 
\v 17 Because he slew me not from the womb; or that my mother might have been
my grave, and her womb \add to be\add* always great \add with me. \add*
\v 18 Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my
days should be consumed with shame?
\c 21
\p
\v 1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent
unto him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the
priest, saying, 
\v 2 Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the LORD will deal with us
according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us. 
\v 3 Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: 
\v 4 Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons
of war that \add are\add* in your hands, wherewith ye fight \add against
\add* the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, which besiege you
without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city. 
\v 5 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a
strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. 
\v 6 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they
shall die of a great pestilence. 
\v 7 And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and
his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the
pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into
the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge
of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.
\p
\v 8 And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set
before you the way of life, and the way of death. 
\v 9 He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine,
and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans
that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey. 
\v 10 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good,
saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he
shall burn it with fire.
\p
\v 11 And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of
the LORD; 
\v 12 O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning,
and deliver \add him that is\add* spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor,
lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench \add it,
\add* because of the evil of your doings. 
\v 13 Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, 
\add and\add* rock of the plain, saith the LORD; which say, Who shall come
down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations? 
\v 14 But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the
LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all
things round about it.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak
there this word, 
\v 2 And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon
the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by
these gates: 
\v 3 Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver
the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence
to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in
this place. 
\v 4 For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of
this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on
horses, he, and his servants, and his people. 
\v 5 But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD,
that this house shall become a desolation. 
\v 6 For thus saith the LORD unto the king’s house of Judah; Thou \add art
\add* Gilead unto me, \add and\add* the head of Lebanon: \add yet\add* surely
I will make thee a wilderness, \add and\add* cities \add which\add* are not
inhabited. 
\v 7 And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons:
and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast \add them\add* into the
fire. 
\v 8 And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to
his neighbour, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this great city? 
\v 9 Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the
LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.
\p
\v 10 Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: \add but\add* weep sore
for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native
country. 
\v 11 For thus saith the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of
Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of
this place; He shall not return thither any more: 
\v 12 But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and
shall see this land no more.
\p
\v 13 Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his
chambers by wrong; \add that\add* useth his neighbour’s service without wages,
and giveth him not for his work; 
\v 14 That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth
him out windows; and \add it is\add* cieled with cedar, and painted with
vermilion. 
\v 15 Shalt thou reign, because thou closest \add thyself\add* in cedar? did
not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, \add and
\add* then \add it was\add* well with him? 
\v 16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then \add it was\add* well 
\add with him: was\add* not this to know me? saith the LORD. 
\v 17 But thine eyes and thine heart \add are\add* not but for thy
covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for
violence, to do \add it. \add*
\v 18 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, \add saying,\add* Ah my brother!
or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, \add saying,\add* Ah lord! or,
Ah his glory! 
\v 19 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth
beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
\p
\v 20 Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from
the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed. 
\v 21 I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; \add but\add* thou saidst, I will
not hear. This \add hath been\add* thy manner from thy youth, that thou
obeyedst not my voice. 
\v 22 The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into
captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy
wickedness. 
\v 23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how
gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in
travail! 
\v 24 \add As\add* I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim
king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee
thence; 
\v 25 And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into
the hand \add of them\add* whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. 
\v 26 And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another
country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die. 
\v 27 But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not
return. 
\v 28 \add Is\add* this man Coniah a despised broken idol? \add is he
\add* a vessel wherein \add is\add* no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out,
he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not? 
\v 29 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD. 
\v 30 Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man \add that
\add* shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper,
sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!
saith the LORD. 
\v 2 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed
my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not
visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the
LORD. 
\v 3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I
have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be
fruitful and increase. 
\v 4 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they
shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the
LORD.
\p
\v 5 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise unto David a
righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute
judgment and justice in the earth. 
\v 6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this
\add is\add* his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.
\v 7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more
say, The LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land
of Egypt; 
\v 8 But, The LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the
house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had
driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.
\p
\v 9 Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones
shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome,
because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness. 
\v 10 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land
mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course
is evil, and their force \add is\add* not right. 
\v 11 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found
their wickedness, saith the LORD. 
\v 12 Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery \add ways\add* in the
darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil
upon them, \add even\add* the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. 
\v 13 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in
Baal, and caused my people Israel to err. 
\v 14 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they
commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of
evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them
unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah. 
\v 15 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold,
I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for
from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land. 
\v 16 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets
that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own
heart, \add and\add* not out of the mouth of the LORD. 
\v 17 They say still unto them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall
have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of
his own heart, No evil shall come upon you. 
\v 18 For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and
heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard \add it? \add*
\v 19 Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous
whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. 
\v 20 The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have executed, and till
he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall
consider it perfectly. 
\v 21 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them,
yet they prophesied. 
\v 22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my
words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the
evil of their doings. 
\v 23 \add Am\add* I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off? 
\v 24 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith
the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD. 
\v 25 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name,
saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. 
\v 26 How long shall \add this\add* be in the heart of the prophets that
prophesy lies? yea, \add they are\add* prophets of the deceit of their own
heart; 
\v 27 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which
they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name
for Baal. 
\v 28 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my
word, let him speak my word faithfully. What \add is\add* the chaff to the
wheat? saith the LORD. 
\v 29 \add Is\add* not my word like as a fire? saith the LORD; and like a
hammer \add that\add* breaketh the rock in pieces? 
\v 30 Therefore, behold, I \add am\add* against the prophets, saith the LORD,
that steal my words every one from his neighbour. 
\v 31 Behold, I \add am\add* against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use
their tongues, and say, He saith. 
\v 32 Behold, I \add am\add* against them that prophesy false dreams, saith
the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by
their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall
not profit this people at all, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 33 And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee,
saying, What \add is\add* the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say unto
them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD. 
\v 34 And \add as for\add* the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that
shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house.
\v 35 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his
brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken? 
\v 36 And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man’s
word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God,
of the LORD of hosts our God. 
\v 37 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee?
and, What hath the LORD spoken? 
\v 38 But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD;
Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent unto you,
saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD; 
\v 39 Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will
forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, \add and cast you
\add* out of my presence: 
\v 40 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual
shame, which shall not be forgotten.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 The LORD shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs \add were
\add* set before the temple of the LORD, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah,
and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and
had brought them to Babylon. 
\v 2 One basket \add had\add* very good figs, \add even\add* like the figs 
\add that are\add* first ripe: and the other basket \add had\add* very naughty
figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. 
\v 3 Then said the LORD unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs;
the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they
are so evil.
\p
\v 4 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
\v 5 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I
acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out
of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for \add their\add* good. 
\v 6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again
to this land: and I will build them, and not pull \add them\add* down; and I
will plant them, and not pluck \add them\add* up. 
\v 7 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I \add am\add* the LORD:
and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return
unto me with their whole heart.
\p
\v 8 And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely
thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his
princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that
dwell in the land of Egypt: 
\v 9 And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth
for \add their\add* hurt, \add to be\add* a reproach and a proverb, a taunt
and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them. 
\v 10 And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them,
till they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their
fathers.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the
fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that \add was
\add* the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; 
\v 2 The which Jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of Judah, and to
all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, 
\v 3 From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even
unto this day, that \add is\add* the three and twentieth year, the word of the
LORD hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking;
but ye have not hearkened. 
\v 4 And the LORD hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising
early and sending \add them;\add* but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your
ear to hear. 
\v 5 They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the
evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given unto you
and to your fathers for ever and ever: 
\v 6 And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and
provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no
hurt. 
\v 7 Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke
me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt.
\p
\v 8 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my
words, 
\v 9 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the
LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them
against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these
nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an
astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations. 
\v 10 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound
of the millstones, and the light of the candle. 
\v 11 And this whole land shall be a desolation, \add and\add* an
astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy
years.
\p
\v 12 And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, 
\add that\add* I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the
LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it
perpetual desolations. 
\v 13 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced
against it, \add even\add* all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah
hath prophesied against all the nations. 
\v 14 For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also:
and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the
works of their own hands.
\p
\v 15 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this
fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
\v 16 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword
that I will send among them. 
\v 17 Then took I the cup at the LORD’S hand, and made all the nations to
drink, unto whom the LORD had sent me: 
\v 18 \add To wit,\add* Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings
thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment,
an hissing, and a curse; as \add it is\add* this day; 
\v 19 Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his
people; 
\v 20 And all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all
the kings of the land of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Azzah, and Ekron,
and the remnant of Ashdod, 
\v 21 Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon, 
\v 22 And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of
the isles which are beyond the sea, 
\v 23 Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all \add that are\add* in the utmost
corners, 
\v 24 And all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people
that dwell in the desert, 
\v 25 And all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings
of the Medes, 
\v 26 And all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another, and all
the kingdoms of the world, which \add are\add* upon the face of the earth: and
the king of Sheshach shall drink after them. 
\v 27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the
God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more,
because of the sword which I will send among you. 
\v 28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink,
then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall
certainly drink. 
\v 29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name,
and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will
call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of
hosts. 
\v 30 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them,
The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy
habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout,
as they that tread \add the grapes,\add* against all the inhabitants of the
earth. 
\v 31 A noise shall come \add even\add* to the ends of the earth; for the LORD
hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will
give them \add that are\add* wicked to the sword, saith the LORD. 
\v 32 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to
nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the
earth. 
\v 33 And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from \add one\add* end of
the earth even unto the \add other\add* end of the earth: they shall not be
lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground.
\p
\v 34 Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves \add in the ashes,
\add* ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your
dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. 
\v 35 And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the
flock to escape. 
\v 36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of
the flock, \add shall be heard:\add* for the LORD hath spoiled their pasture.
\v 37 And the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger
of the LORD. 
\v 38 He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate
because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
Judah came this word from the LORD, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD; Stand in the court of the LORD’S house, and speak
unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the LORD’S house, all
the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word: 
\v 3 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I
may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil
of their doings. 
\v 4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; If ye will not hearken
to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you, 
\v 5 To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I sent unto
you, both rising up early, and sending \add them,\add* but ye have not
hearkened; 
\v 6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse
to all the nations of the earth. 
\v 7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah
speaking these words in the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 8 Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that
the LORD had commanded \add him\add* to speak unto all the people, that the
priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt
surely die. 
\v 9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house
shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant?
And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 10 When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the
king’s house unto the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new
gate of the LORD’S \add house. \add*
\v 11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the
people, saying, This man \add is\add* worthy to die; for he hath prophesied
against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.
\p
\v 12 Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying,
The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the
words that ye have heard. 
\v 13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the
LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he hath
pronounced against you. 
\v 14 As for me, behold, I \add am\add* in your hand: do with me as seemeth
good and meet unto you. 
\v 15 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely
bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the
inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me unto you to speak
all these words in your ears.
\p
\v 16 Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the
prophets; This man \add is\add* not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in
the name of the LORD our God. 
\v 17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the
assembly of the people, saying, 
\v 18 Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah,
and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
Zion shall be plowed \add like\add* a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps,
and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest. 
\v 19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he
not fear the LORD, and besought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the
evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil
against our souls. 
\v 20 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah
the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and
against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah: 
\v 21 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the
princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah
heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; 
\v 22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, \add namely,\add* Elnathan
the son of Achbor, and \add certain\add* men with him into Egypt. 
\v 23 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto
Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into
the graves of the common people. 
\v 24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah,
that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to
death.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon
thy neck, 
\v 3 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the
king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by
the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of
Judah; 
\v 4 And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts,
the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters; 
\v 5 I have made the earth, the man and the beast that \add are\add* upon the
ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto
whom it seemed meet unto me. 
\v 6 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the
king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also
to serve him. 
\v 7 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until
the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall
serve themselves of him. 
\v 8 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* the nation and kingdom which
will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not
put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I
punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the
pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. 
\v 9 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to
your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto
you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: 
\v 10 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and
that I should drive you out, and ye should perish. 
\v 11 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of
Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith
the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
\p
\v 12 I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words,
saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him
and his people, and live. 
\v 13 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and
by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not
serve the king of Babylon? 
\v 14 Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto
you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie
unto you. 
\v 15 For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my
name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the
prophets that prophesy unto you. 
\v 16 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith
the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you,
saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD’S house shall now shortly be brought
again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you. 
\v 17 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore
should this city be laid waste? 
\v 18 But if they \add be\add* prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with
them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels
which are left in the house of the LORD, and \add in\add* the house of the
king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
\p
\v 19 For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning
the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels
that remain in this city, 
\v 20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away
captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon,
and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 
\v 21 Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the
vessels that remain \add in\add* the house of the LORD, and \add in
\add* the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem; 
\v 22 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day
that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them
to this place.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of
Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, \add and\add* in the fifth month,
\add that\add* Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which \add was
\add* of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of
the priests and of all the people, saying, 
\v 2 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken
the yoke of the king of Babylon. 
\v 3 Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels
of the LORD’S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this
place, and carried them to Babylon: 
\v 4 And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king
of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the
LORD: for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
\p
\v 5 Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence
of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house
of the LORD, 
\v 6 Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform
thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD’S
house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place. 
\v 7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in
the ears of all the people; 
\v 8 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied
both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil,
and of pestilence. 
\v 9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet
shall come to pass, \add then\add* shall the prophet be known, that the LORD
hath truly sent him.
\p
\v 10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s
neck, and brake it. 
\v 11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith
the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from
the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet
Jeremiah went his way.
\p
\v 12 Then the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah \add the prophet,
\add* after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of
the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 13 Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the
yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. 
\v 14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke
of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar
king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of
the field also.
\p
\v 15 Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now,
Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in
a lie. 
\v 16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the
face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught
rebellion against the LORD. 
\v 17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet
sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away
captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom
Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon; 
\v 2 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the
princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were
departed from Jerusalem;) 
\v 3 By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of
Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon) saying, 
\v 4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that are
carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem
unto Babylon; 
\v 5 Build ye houses, and dwell \add in them;\add* and plant gardens, and eat
the fruit of them; 
\v 6 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your
sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and
daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. 
\v 7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried
away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall
ye have peace.
\p
\v 8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your
prophets and your diviners, that \add be\add* in the midst of you, deceive
you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. 
\v 9 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them,
saith the LORD.
\p
\v 10 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be accomplished at
Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word toward you, in causing you
to return to this place. 
\v 11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the LORD,
thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. 
\v 12 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will
hearken unto you. 
\v 13 And ye shall seek me, and find \add me,\add* when ye shall search for me
with all your heart. 
\v 14 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your
captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places
whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I will bring you again into the
place whence I caused you to be carried away captive.
\p
\v 15 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in Babylon; 
\v 16 \add Know\add* that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon
the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, 
\add and\add* of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into
captivity; 
\v 17 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword,
the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot
be eaten, they are so evil. 
\v 18 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the
pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the
earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an hissing, and a reproach,
among all the nations whither I have driven them: 
\v 19 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I
sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and sending 
\add them;\add* but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 20 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I
have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: 
\v 21 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the son of
Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a lie unto you in
my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; 
\v 22 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah
which \add are\add* in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and
like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; 
\v 23 Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed
adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lying words in my name,
which I have not commanded them; even I know, and \add am\add* a witness,
saith the LORD.
\p
\v 24 \add Thus\add* shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite,
saying, 
\v 25 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou
hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that \add are\add* at
Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the
priests, saying, 
\v 26 The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that
ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man \add that is
\add* mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in
prison, and in the stocks. 
\v 27 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which
maketh himself a prophet to you? 
\v 28 For therefore he sent unto us \add in\add* Babylon, saying, This 
\add captivity is\add* long: build ye houses, and dwell \add in them;
\add* and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them. 
\v 29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the
prophet.
\p
\v 30 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 31 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD
concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath prophesied unto
you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: 
\v 32 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the
Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people;
neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD;
because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
\v 2 Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words
that I have spoken unto thee in a book. 
\v 3 For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will bring again the
captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them
to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess
it.
\p
\v 4 And these \add are\add* the words that the LORD spake concerning Israel
and concerning Judah. 
\v 5 For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and
not of peace. 
\v 6 Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? wherefore do I
see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all
faces are turned into paleness? 
\v 7 Alas! for that day \add is\add* great, so that none \add is\add* like it:
it \add is\add* even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of
it. 
\v 8 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, 
\add that\add* I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy
bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him: 
\v 9 But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I
will raise up unto them.
\p
\v 10 Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be
dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the
land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be
quiet, and none shall make \add him\add* afraid. 
\v 11 For I \add am\add* with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I
make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not
make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not
leave thee altogether unpunished. 
\v 12 For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise \add is\add* incurable, \add and
\add* thy wound \add is\add* grievous. 
\v 13 \add There is\add* none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound
up: thou hast no healing medicines. 
\v 14 All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have
wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one,
for the multitude of thine iniquity; \add because\add* thy sins were
increased. 
\v 15 Why criest thou for thine affliction? thy sorrow \add is\add* incurable
for the multitude of thine iniquity: \add because\add* thy sins were
increased, I have done these things unto thee. 
\v 16 Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine
adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil
thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. 
\v 17 For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds,
saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, \add saying,\add* This 
\add is\add* Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
\p
\v 18 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s
tents, and have mercy on his dwellingplaces; and the city shall be builded
upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof. 
\v 19 And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that
make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also
glorify them, and they shall not be small. 
\v 20 Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall
be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them. 
\v 21 And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall
proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he
shall approach unto me: for who \add is\add* this that engaged his heart to
approach unto me? saith the LORD. 
\v 22 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. 
\v 23 Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing
whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. 
\v 24 The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he have done 
\add it,\add* and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the
latter days ye shall consider it.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the families
of Israel, and they shall be my people. 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD, The people \add which were\add* left of the sword
found grace in the wilderness; \add even\add* Israel, when I went to cause him
to rest. 
\v 3 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, \add saying,\add* Yea, I have
loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I
drawn thee. 
\v 4 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel:
thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances
of them that make merry. 
\v 5 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters
shall plant, and shall eat \add them\add* as common things. 
\v 6 For there shall be a day, \add that\add* the watchmen upon the mount
Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our God. 
\v 7 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among
the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy
people, the remnant of Israel. 
\v 8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from
the coasts of the earth, \add and\add* with them the blind and the lame, the
woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company
shall return thither. 
\v 9 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I
will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein
they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim \add is
\add* my firstborn.
\p
\v 10 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare \add it\add* in the
isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep
him, as a shepherd \add doth\add* his flock. 
\v 11 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of 
\add him that was\add* stronger than he. 
\v 12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow
together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil,
and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a
watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. 
\v 13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old
together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and
make them rejoice from their sorrow. 
\v 14 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people
shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 15 Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, 
\add and\add* bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be
comforted for her children, because they \add were\add* not. 
\v 16 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from
tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come
again from the land of the enemy. 
\v 17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall
come again to their own border.
\p
\v 18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself \add thus;\add* Thou hast
chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed \add to the
yoke:\add* turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou \add art\add* the
LORD my God. 
\v 19 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was
instructed, I smote upon \add my\add* thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even
confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. 
\v 20 \add Is\add* Ephraim my dear son? \add is he\add* a pleasant child? for
since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my
bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the
LORD. 
\v 21 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the
highway, \add even\add* the way \add which\add* thou wentest: turn again, O
virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
\p
\v 22 How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD
hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man. 
\v 23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use
this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring
again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, 
\add and\add* mountain of holiness. 
\v 24 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities thereof
together, husbandmen, and they \add that\add* go forth with flocks. 
\v 25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every
sorrowful soul. 
\v 26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
\p
\v 27 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of
Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of
beast. 
\v 28 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* like as I have watched over
them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and
to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith the
LORD. 
\v 29 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour
grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge. 
\v 30 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the
sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.
\p
\v 31 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant
with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 
\v 32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day
\add that\add* I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt;
which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the
LORD: 
\v 33 But this \add shall be\add* the covenant that I will make with the house
of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward
parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be
my people. 
\v 34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his
brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of
them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD; for I will forgive their
iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.
\p
\v 35 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day, 
\add and\add* the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by
night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts 
\add is\add* his name: 
\v 36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, \add then
\add* the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for
ever. 
\v 37 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the
foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the
seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 38 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to
the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the corner. 
\v 39 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill
Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. 
\v 40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the
fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the
east, \add shall be\add* holy unto the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor
thrown down any more for ever.

\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of
Zedekiah king of Judah, which \add was\add* the eighteenth year of
Nebuchadrezzar. 
\v 2 For then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the
prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which \add was\add* in the
king of Judah’s house. 
\v 3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou
prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the
hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; 
\v 4 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the
Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon,
and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; 
\v 5 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I
visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not
prosper?
\p
\v 6 And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
\v 7 Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee,
saying, Buy thee my field that \add is\add* in Anathoth: for the right of
redemption \add is\add* thine to buy \add it. \add*
\v 8 So Hanameel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the prison
according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray
thee, that \add is\add* in Anathoth, which \add is\add* in the country of
Benjamin: for the right of inheritance \add is\add* thine, and the redemption
\add is\add* thine; buy \add it\add* for thyself. Then I knew that this 
\add was\add* the word of the LORD. 
\v 9 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that \add was
\add* in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, \add even\add* seventeen shekels
of silver. 
\v 10 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed \add it,\add* and took
witnesses, and weighed \add him\add* the money in the balances. 
\v 11 So I took the evidence of the purchase, \add both\add* that which was
sealed \add according\add* to the law and custom, and that which was open: 
\v 12 And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah,
the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine uncle’s \add son,
\add* and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the
purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
\p
\v 13 And I charged Baruch before them, saying, 
\v 14 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences,
this evidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this evidence which
is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.
\v 15 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields
and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.
\p
\v 16 Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the
son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying, 
\v 17 Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy
great power and stretched out arm, \add and\add* there is nothing too hard for
thee: 
\v 18 Thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands, and recompensest the
iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the
Great, the Mighty God, the LORD of hosts, \add is\add* his name, 
\v 19 Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thine eyes \add are
\add* open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according
to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: 
\v 20 Which hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, \add even
\add* unto this day, and in Israel, and among \add other\add* men; and hast
made thee a name, as at this day; 
\v 21 And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with
signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm,
and with great terror; 
\v 22 And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers
to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; 
\v 23 And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice,
neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst
them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them: 
\v 24 Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city
is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the
sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is
come to pass; and, behold, thou seest \add it. \add*
\v 25 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money,
and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
\p
\v 26 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 27 Behold, I \add am\add* the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any
thing too hard for me? 
\v 28 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the
hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
and he shall take it: 
\v 29 And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire
on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered
incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke
me to anger. 
\v 30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil
before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me
to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD. 
\v 31 For this city hath been to me \add as\add* a provocation of mine anger
and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I
should remove it from before my face, 
\v 32 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of
Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their
princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the
inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 33 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught
them, rising up early and teaching \add them,\add* yet they have not hearkened
to receive instruction. 
\v 34 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my
name, to defile it. 
\v 35 And they built the high places of Baal, which \add are\add* in the
valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass
through \add the fire\add* unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither
came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to
sin.
\p
\v 36 And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning
this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of
Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; 
\v 37 Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven
them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them
again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely: 
\v 38 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God: 
\v 39 And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for
ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: 
\v 40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn
away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that
they shall not depart from me. 
\v 41 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in
this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. 
\v 42 For thus saith the LORD; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon
this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised
them. 
\v 43 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, \add It is
\add* desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the
Chaldeans. 
\v 44 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal 
\add them,\add* and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places
about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the
mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south:
for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah the second time, while
he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD the maker thereof, the LORD that formed it, to
establish it; the LORD \add is\add* his name; 
\v 3 Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty
things, which thou knowest not. 
\v 4 For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this
city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down
by the mounts, and by the sword; 
\v 5 They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but \add it is\add* fill them with
the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in mine anger and in my fury, and
for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. 
\v 6 Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will
reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth. 
\v 7 And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to
return, and will build them, as at the first. 
\v 8 And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby they have sinned
against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned,
and whereby they have transgressed against me.
\p
\v 9 And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and an honour before all
the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do unto them:
and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the
prosperity that I procure unto it. 
\v 10 Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye
say \add shall be\add* desolate without man and without beast, \add even
\add* in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are
desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast, 
\v 11 The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say,
Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD \add is\add* good; for his mercy 
\add endureth\add* for ever: \add and\add* of them that shall bring the
sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the
captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD. 
\v 12 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate
without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, shall be an
habitation of shepherds causing \add their\add* flocks to lie down. 
\v 13 In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the
cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about
Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the
hands of him that telleth \add them,\add* saith the LORD. 
\v 14 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good
thing which I have promised unto the house of Israel and to the house of
Judah.
\p
\v 15 In those days, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of
righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and
righteousness in the land. 
\v 16 In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely:
and this \add is the name\add* wherewith she shall be called, The LORD our
righteousness.
\p
\v 17 For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the
throne of the house of Israel; 
\v 18 Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer
burnt offerings, and to kindle meat offerings, and to do sacrifice
continually.
\p
\v 19 And the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 20 Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my
covenant of the night, and that there should not be day and night in their
season; 
\v 21 \add Then\add* may also my covenant be broken with David my servant,
that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites
the priests, my ministers. 
\v 22 As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea
measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites
that minister unto me. 
\v 23 Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 24 Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two
families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they
have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them. 
\v 25 Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant be not with day and night, 
\add and if\add* I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; 
\v 26 Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I
will not take \add any\add* of his seed \add to be\add* rulers over the seed
of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will cause their captivity to return, and
have mercy on them.
\c 34
\p
\v 1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his
dominion, and all the people, fought against Jerusalem, and against all the
cities thereof, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of
Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into
the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire: 
\v 3 And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and
delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of
Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to
Babylon. 
\v 4 Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the
LORD of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: 
\v 5 \add But\add* thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy
fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn 
\add odours\add* for thee; and they will lament thee, \add saying,\add* Ah
lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD. 
\v 6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of
Judah in Jerusalem, 
\v 7 When the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all
the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for
these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.
\p
\v 8 \add This is\add* the word that came unto Jeremiah from the LORD, after
that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which 
\add were\add* at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them; 
\v 9 That every man should let his manservant, and every man his maidservant,
\add being\add* an Hebrew or an Hebrewess, go free; that none should serve
himself of them, \add to wit,\add* of a Jew his brother. 
\v 10 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the
covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his
maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then
they obeyed, and let \add them\add* go. 
\v 11 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids,
whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for
servants and for handmaids.
\p
\v 12 Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, 
\v 13 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your
fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of
the house of bondmen, saying, 
\v 14 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew,
which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou
shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me,
neither inclined their ear. 
\v 15 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming
liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in
the house which is called by my name: 
\v 16 But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant,
and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to
return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for
handmaids. 
\v 17 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in
proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour:
behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the
pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the
kingdoms of the earth. 
\v 18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have
not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when
they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof, 
\v 19 The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the
priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the
calf; 
\v 20 I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand
of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the
fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. 
\v 21 And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give into the hand of
their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the
hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from you. 
\v 22 Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this
city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and
I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant.
\c 35
\p
\v 1 The word which came unto Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim
the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 
\v 2 Go unto the house of the Rechabites, and speak unto them, and bring them
into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to
drink. 
\v 3 Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his
brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; 
\v 4 And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the
sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, which \add was\add* by the
chamber of the princes, which \add was\add* above the chamber of Maaseiah the
son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: 
\v 5 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of
wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine. 
\v 6 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our
father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, \add neither\add* ye, nor
your sons for ever: 
\v 7 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have
\add any:\add* but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live
many days in the land where ye \add be\add* strangers. 
\v 8 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in
all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our
sons, nor our daughters; 
\v 9 Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor
field, nor seed: 
\v 10 But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all
that Jonadab our father commanded us. 
\v 11 But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into
the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army
of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at
Jerusalem.
\p
\v 12 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 13 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of
Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to
hearken to my words? saith the LORD. 
\v 14 The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not
to drink wine, are performed; for unto this day they drink none, but obey
their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising
early and speaking; but ye hearkened not unto me. 
\v 15 I have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets, rising up early
and sending \add them,\add* saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way,
and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall
dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have
not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me. 
\v 16 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the
commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not
hearkened unto me: 
\v 17 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil
that I have pronounced against them: because I have spoken unto them, but they
have not heard; and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.
\p
\v 18 And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD
of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab
your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according unto all that he
hath commanded you: 
\v 19 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the
son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever.
\c 36
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
king of Judah, \add that\add* this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD,
saying, 
\v 2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have
spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the
nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even into
this day. 
\v 3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose
to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may
forgive their iniquity and their sin. 
\v 4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the
mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken unto him,
upon a roll of a book. 
\v 5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I \add am\add* shut up; I cannot
go into the house of the LORD: 
\v 6 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my
mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD’S house
upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah
that come out of their cities. 
\v 7 It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will
return every one from his evil way: for great \add is\add* the anger and the
fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people. 
\v 8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the
prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD’S
house. 
\v 9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king
of Judah, in the ninth month, \add that\add* they proclaimed a fast before the
LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the
cities of Judah unto Jerusalem. 
\v 10 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the
LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher
court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD’S house, in the ears of all
the people.
\p
\v 11 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of
the book all the words of the LORD, 
\v 12 Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber: and,
lo, all the princes sat there, \add even\add* Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah
the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of
Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. 
\v 13 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when
Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. 
\v 14 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of
Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll
wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son
of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them. 
\v 15 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch
read \add it\add* in their ears. 
\v 16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid
both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all
these words. 
\v 17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all
these words at his mouth? 
\v 18 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with
his mouth, and I wrote \add them\add* with ink in the book. 
\v 19 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and
let no man know where ye be.
\p
\v 20 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll
in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of
the king. 
\v 21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of
Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and
in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king. 
\v 22 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and \add there
was a fire\add* on the hearth burning before him. 
\v 23 And it came to pass, \add that\add* when Jehudi had read three or four
leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast \add it\add* into the fire that
\add was\add* on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that
\add was\add* on the hearth. 
\v 24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, \add neither
\add* the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. 
\v 25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to
the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them. 
\v 26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the
son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and
Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.
\p
\v 27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had
burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah,
saying, 
\v 28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that
were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned. 
\v 29 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim the king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD;
Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The
king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to
cease from thence man and beast? 
\v 30 Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have
none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in
the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. 
\v 31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity;
and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon
the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they
hearkened not.
\p
\v 32 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the
son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of
the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were
added besides unto them many like words.
\c 37
\p
\v 1 And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of
Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of
Judah. 
\v 2 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken
unto the words of the LORD, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah. 
\v 3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the
son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the
LORD our God for us. 
\v 4 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put
him into prison. 
\v 5 Then Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans
that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 6 Then came the word of the LORD unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying, 
\v 7 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of
Judah, that sent you unto me to enquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh’s army, which
is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. 
\v 8 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take
it, and burn it with fire. 
\v 9 Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall
surely depart from us: for they shall not depart. 
\v 10 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight
against you, and there remained \add but\add* wounded men among them, 
\add yet\add* should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city
with fire.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up
from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army, 
\v 12 Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of
Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people. 
\v 13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward 
\add was\add* there, whose name \add was\add* Irijah, the son of Shelemiah,
the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest
away to the Chaldeans. 
\v 14 Then said Jeremiah, \add It is\add* false; I fall not away to the
Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought
him to the princes. 
\v 15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put
him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the
prison.
\p
\v 16 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and
Jeremiah had remained there many days; 
\v 17 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him
secretly in his house, and said, Is there \add any\add* word from the LORD?
And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the
hand of the king of Babylon. 
\v 18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against
thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in
prison? 
\v 19 Where \add are\add* now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying,
The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? 
\v 20 Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my
supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to
return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. 
\v 21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into
the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread
out of the bakers street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus
Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and
Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words
that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the
sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the
Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live. 
\v 3 Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the
king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it. 
\v 4 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man
be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain
in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto
them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt. 
\v 5 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king 
\add is\add* not \add he that\add* can do \add any\add* thing against you. 
\v 6 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the
son of Hammelech, that \add was\add* in the court of the prison: and they let
down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon \add there was\add* no water, but
mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
\p
\v 7 Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the
king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then
sitting in the gate of Benjamin; 
\v 8 Ebed-melech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the king,
saying, 
\v 9 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to
Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to
die for hunger in the place where he is: for \add there is\add* no more bread
in the city. 
\v 10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from
hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the
dungeon, before he die. 
\v 11 So Ebed- melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the
king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags,
and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. 
\v 12 And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now \add these
\add* old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords.
And Jeremiah did so. 
\v 13 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon:
and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\p
\v 14 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into
the third entry that \add is\add* in the house of the LORD: and the king said
unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me. 
\v 15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare \add it\add* unto thee,
wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou
not hearken unto me? 
\v 16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, \add As
\add* the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death,
neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life. 
\v 17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts,
the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon’s
princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with
fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house: 
\v 18 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then
shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn
it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand. 
\v 19 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that
are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they
mock me. 
\v 20 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver \add thee.\add* Obey, I
beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be
well unto thee, and thy soul shall live. 
\v 21 But if thou refuse to go forth, this \add is\add* the word that the LORD
hath shewed me: 
\v 22 And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house 
\add shall be\add* brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those 
\add women\add* shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed
against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, \add and\add* they are turned
away back. 
\v 23 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans:
and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of
the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
\p
\v 24 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and
thou shalt not die. 
\v 25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto
thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the
king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the
king said unto thee: 
\v 26 Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the
king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.
\v 27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them
according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off
speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. 
\v 28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that
Jerusalem was taken: and he was \add there\add* when Jerusalem was taken.
\c 39
\p
\v 1 In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they
besieged it. 
\v 2 \add And\add* in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the
ninth \add day\add* of the month, the city was broken up. 
\v 3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle
gate, \add even\add* Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab- saris,
Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of
Babylon.
\p
\v 4 And it came to pass, \add that\add* when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw
them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city
by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls:
and he went out the way of the plain. 
\v 5 But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the
plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave
judgment upon him. 
\v 6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his
eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. 
\v 7 Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry
him to Babylon.
\p
\v 8 And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people,
with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem. 
\v 9 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into
Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that
fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained. 
\v 10 But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the
people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and
fields at the same time.
\p
\v 11 Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to
Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying, 
\v 12 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even
as he shall say unto thee. 
\v 13 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban,
Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s
princes; 
\v 14 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and
committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he
should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.
\p
\v 15 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the
court of the prison, saying, 
\v 16 Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the LORD
of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for
evil, and not for good; and they shall be \add accomplished\add* in that day
before thee. 
\v 17 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not
be given into the hand of the men of whom thou \add art\add* afraid. 
\v 18 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword,
but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in
me, saith the LORD.
\c 40
\p
\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzar-adan the
captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being
bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and
Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon. 
\v 2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The LORD
thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. 
\v 3 Now the LORD hath brought \add it,\add* and done according as he hath
said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice,
therefore this thing is come upon you. 
\v 4 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which \add were
\add* upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon,
come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come
with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land \add is\add* before thee:
whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go. 
\v 5 Now while he was not yet gone back, \add he said,\add* Go back also to
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath
made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people:
or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the
guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go. 
\v 6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt
with him among the people that were left in the land.
\p
\v 7 Now when all the captains of the forces which \add were\add* in the
fields, \add even\add* they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had
made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto
him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that
were not carried away captive to Babylon; 
\v 8 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth,
and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite,
they and their men. 
\v 9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to
their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and
serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. 
\v 10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which
will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put
\add them\add* in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken. 
\v 11 Likewise when all the Jews that \add were\add* in Moab, and among the
Ammonites, and in Edom, and that \add were\add* in all the countries, heard
that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over
them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; 
\v 12 Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven,
and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and
summer fruits very much.
\p
\v 13 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
that \add were\add* in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, 
\v 14 And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the
Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah
the son of Ahikam believed them not. 
\v 15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly,
saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,
and no man shall know \add it:\add* wherefore should he slay thee, that all
the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in
Judah perish? 
\v 16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou
shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.
\c 41
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass in the seventh month, \add that\add* Ishmael the son
of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the
king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah. 
\v 2 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with
him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword,
and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. 
\v 3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, \add even\add* with
Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, \add and
\add* the men of war. 
\v 4 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no
man knew \add it, \add*
\v 5 That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, 
\add even\add* fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes
rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to
bring \add them\add* to the house of the LORD. 
\v 6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them,
weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said
unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. 
\v 7 And it was \add so,\add* when they came into the midst of the city, that
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, \add and cast them\add* into the midst
of the pit, he, and the men that \add were\add* with him. 
\v 8 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not:
for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and
of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren. 
\v 9 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom
he had slain because of Gedaliah, \add was\add* it which Asa the king had made
for fear of Baasha king of Israel: \add and\add* Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
filled it with \add them that were\add* slain. 
\v 10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that 
\add were\add* in Mizpah, \add even\add* the king’s daughters, and all the
people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had
committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah
carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
\p
\v 11 But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
that \add were\add* with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah had done, 
\v 12 Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that \add are\add* in Gibeon. 
\v 13 Now it came to pass, \add that\add* when all the people which 
\add were\add* with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the
captains of the forces that \add were\add* with him, then they were glad. 
\v 14 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast
about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah. 
\v 15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men,
and went to the Ammonites. 
\v 16 Then took Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces
that \add were\add* with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had
recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after \add that
\add* he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, \add even\add* mighty men of
war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought
again from Gibeon: 
\v 17 And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by
Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt, 
\v 18 Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael
the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of
Babylon made governor in the land.
\c 42
\p
\v 1 Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and
Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the
greatest, came near, 
\v 2 And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD thy God, 
\add even\add* for all this remnant; (for we are left \add but\add* a few of
many, as thine eyes do behold us:) 
\v 3 That the LORD thy God may shew us the way wherein we may walk, and the
thing that we may do. 
\v 4 Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard \add you;
\add* behold, I will pray unto the LORD your God according to your words; and
it shall come to pass, \add that\add* whatsoever thing the LORD shall answer
you, I will declare \add it\add* unto you; I will keep nothing back from you.
\v 5 Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness
between us, if we do not even according to all things for the which the LORD
thy God shall send thee to us. 
\v 6 Whether \add it be\add* good, or whether \add it be\add* evil, we will
obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well
with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God.
\p
\v 7 And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came unto
Jeremiah. 
\v 8 Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces which \add were\add* with him, and all the people from the least even
to the greatest, 
\v 9 And said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto whom ye
sent me to present your supplication before him; 
\v 10 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull
\add you\add* down, and I will plant you, and not pluck \add you\add* up: for
I repent me of the evil that I have done unto you. 
\v 11 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not
afraid of him, saith the LORD: for I \add am\add* with you to save you, and to
deliver you from his hand. 
\v 12 And I will shew mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you, and
cause you to return to your own land.
\p
\v 13 But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of
the LORD your God, 
\v 14 Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no
war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor have hunger of bread; and there
will we dwell: 
\v 15 And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus
saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to
enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; 
\v 16 Then it shall come to pass, \add that\add* the sword, which ye feared,
shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, whereof ye were
afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. 
\v 17 So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to
sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the
pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will
bring upon them. 
\v 18 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As mine anger and
my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem; so shall my
fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be
an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall
see this place no more.
\p
\v 19 The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into
Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day. 
\v 20 For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me unto the LORD your
God, saying, Pray for us unto the LORD our God; and according unto all that
the LORD our God shall say, so declare unto us, and we will do \add it. 
\add*
\v 21 And \add now\add* I have this day declared \add it\add* to you; but ye
have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any \add thing\add* for
the which he hath sent me unto you. 
\v 22 Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the
famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go 
\add and\add* to sojourn.
\c 43
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, \add that\add* when Jeremiah had made an end of
speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which
the LORD their God had sent him to them, \add even\add* all these words, 
\v 2 Then spake Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah,
and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD
our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there: 
\v 3 But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, for to deliver
us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death, and carry
us away captives into Babylon. 
\v 4 So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all
the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah. 
\v 5 But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took
all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all nations, whither they
had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; 
\v 6 \add Even\add* men, and women, and children, and the king’s daughters,
and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and
Baruch the son of Neriah. 
\v 7 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the
LORD: thus came they \add even\add* to Tahpanhes.
\p
\v 8 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, 
\v 9 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the
brickkiln, which \add is\add* at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in
the sight of the men of Judah; 
\v 10 And say unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant,
and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread
his royal pavilion over them. 
\v 11 And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, \add and deliver
\add* such \add as are\add* for death to death; and such \add as are
\add* for captivity to captivity; and such \add as are\add* for the sword to
the sword. 
\v 12 And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he
shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with
the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth
from thence in peace. 
\v 13 He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that \add is\add* in the
land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with
fire.

\v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwell in the
land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in
the country of Pathros, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the
evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah;
and, behold, this day they \add are\add* a desolation, and no man dwelleth
therein, 
\v 3 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to
anger, in that they went to burn incense, \add and\add* to serve other gods,
whom they knew not, \add neither\add* they, ye, nor your fathers. 
\v 4 Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and
sending \add them,\add* saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
\v 5 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their
wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. 
\v 6 Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the
cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted 
\add and\add* desolate, as at this day. 
\v 7 Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel;
Wherefore commit ye \add this\add* great evil against your souls, to cut off
from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to
remain; 
\v 8 In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning
incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye be gone to dwell,
that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach
among all the nations of the earth? 
\v 9 Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of
the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own
wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the
land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
\v 10 They are not humbled \add even\add* unto this day, neither have they
feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and
before your fathers.
\p
\v 11 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah. 
\v 12 And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go
into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, 
\add and\add* fall in the land of Egypt; they shall \add even\add* be consumed
by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the
greatest, by the sword \add and\add* by the famine: and they shall be an
execration, \add and\add* an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. 
\v 13 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have
punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: 
\v 14 So that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of
Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into
the land of Judah, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there:
for none shall return but such as shall escape.
\p
\v 15 Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto
other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the
people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah,
saying, 
\v 16 \add As for\add* the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of
the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee. 
\v 17 But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own
mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink
offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our
princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for 
\add then\add* had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. 
\v 18 But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to
pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all \add things,\add* and
have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. 
\v 19 And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink
offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink
offerings unto her, without our men?
\p
\v 20 Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women,
and to all the people which had given him \add that\add* answer, saying, 
\v 21 The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of
Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people
of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it \add not\add* into
his mind? 
\v 22 So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your
doings, \add and\add* because of the abominations which ye have committed;
therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without
an inhabitant, as at this day. 
\v 23 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the
LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in
his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto
you, as at this day. 
\v 24 Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear
the word of the LORD, all Judah that \add are\add* in the land of Egypt: 
\v 25 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your
wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying,
We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the
queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely
accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows. 
\v 26 Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land
of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name
shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of
Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth. 
\v 27 Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the
men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and
by the famine, until there be an end of them. 
\v 28 Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of
Egypt into the land of Judah, and all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into
the land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine,
or theirs.
\p
\v 29 And this \add shall be\add* a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will
punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand
against you for evil: 
\v 30 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaoh-hophra king of Egypt
into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as
I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,
his enemy, and that sought his life.
\c 45
\p
\v 1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spake unto Baruch the son of Neriah,
when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the
fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, unto thee, O Baruch; 
\v 3 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my
sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.
\p
\v 4 Thus shalt thou say unto him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, \add that
\add* which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I
will pluck up, even this whole land. 
\v 5 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek \add them\add* not: for,
behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I
give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.
\c 46
\p
\v 1 The word of the LORD which came to Jeremiah the prophet against the
Gentiles; 
\v 2 Against Egypt, against the army of Pharaoh-necho king of Egypt, which was
by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah. 
\v 3 Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle. 
\v 4 Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with 
\add your\add* helmets; furbish the spears, \add and\add* put on the
brigandines. 
\v 5 Wherefore have I seen them dismayed \add and\add* turned away back? and
their mighty ones are beaten down, and are fled apace, and look not back: 
\add for\add* fear \add was\add* round about, saith the LORD. 
\v 6 Let not the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they shall
stumble, and fall toward the north by the river Euphrates. 
\v 7 Who \add is\add* this \add that\add* cometh up as a flood, whose waters
are moved as the rivers? 
\v 8 Egypt riseth up like a flood, and \add his\add* waters are moved like the
rivers; and he saith, I will go up, \add and\add* will cover the earth; I will
destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof. 
\v 9 Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come
forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the
Lydians, that handle \add and\add* bend the bow. 
\v 10 For this \add is\add* the day of the Lord GOD of hosts, a day of
vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries: and the sword shall
devour, and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood: for the Lord
GOD of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river Euphrates. 
\v 11 Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in
vain shalt thou use many medicines; \add for\add* thou shalt not be cured. 
\v 12 The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry hath filled the land:
for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty, \add and\add* they are
fallen both together.
\p
\v 13 The word that the LORD spake to Jeremiah the prophet, how Nebuchadrezzar
king of Babylon should come \add and\add* smite the land of Egypt. 
\v 14 Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Noph and in
Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour
round about thee. 
\v 15 Why are thy valiant \add men\add* swept away? they stood not, because
the LORD did drive them. 
\v 16 He made many to fall, yea, one fell upon another: and they said, Arise,
and let us go again to our own people, and to the land of our nativity, from
the oppressing sword. 
\v 17 They did cry there, Pharaoh king of Egypt \add is but\add* a noise; he
hath passed the time appointed. 
\v 18 \add As\add* I live, saith the King, whose name \add is\add* the LORD of
hosts, Surely as Tabor \add is\add* among the mountains, and as Carmel by the
sea, \add so\add* shall he come. 
\v 19 O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity:
for Noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant. 
\v 20 Egypt \add is like\add* a very fair heifer, \add but\add* destruction
cometh; it cometh out of the north. 
\v 21 Also her hired men \add are\add* in the midst of her like fatted
bullocks; for they also are turned back, \add and\add* are fled away together:
they did not stand, because the day of their calamity was come upon them, 
\add and\add* the time of their visitation. 
\v 22 The voice thereof shall go like a serpent; for they shall march with an
army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of wood. 
\v 23 They shall cut down her forest, saith the LORD, though it cannot be
searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and \add are
\add* innumerable. 
\v 24 The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into
the hand of the people of the north. 
\v 25 The LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saith; Behold, I will punish the
multitude of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with their gods, and their kings;
even Pharaoh, and \add all\add* them that trust in him: 
\v 26 And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives,
and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his
servants: and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith
the LORD.
\p
\v 27 But fear not thou, O my servant Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel:
for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of
their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be in rest and at ease, and none
shall make \add him\add* afraid. 
\v 28 Fear thou not, O Jacob my servant, saith the LORD: for I \add am
\add* with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have
driven thee: but I will not make a full end of thee, but correct thee in
measure; yet will I not leave thee wholly unpunished.
\c 47
\p
\v 1 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against the
Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall
be an overflowing flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein;
the city, and them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the
inhabitants of the land shall howl. 
\v 3 At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong \add horses,
\add* at the rushing of his chariots, \add and at\add* the rumbling of his
wheels, the fathers shall not look back to \add their\add* children for
feebleness of hands; 
\v 4 Because of the day that cometh to spoil all the Philistines, \add and
\add* to cut off from Tyrus and Zidon every helper that remaineth: for the
LORD will spoil the Philistines, the remnant of the country of Caphtor. 
\v 5 Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off \add with\add* the
remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself? 
\v 6 O thou sword of the LORD, how long \add will it be\add* ere thou be
quiet? put up thyself into thy scabbard, rest, and be still. 
\v 7 How can it be quiet, seeing the LORD hath given it a charge against
Ashkelon, and against the sea shore? there hath he appointed it.
\c 48
\p
\v 1 Against Moab thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Woe unto
Nebo! for it is spoiled: Kiriathaim is confounded \add and\add* taken: Misgab
is confounded and dismayed. 
\v 2 \add There shall be\add* no more praise of Moab: in Heshbon they have
devised evil against it; come, and let us cut it off from \add being
\add* a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue
thee. 
\v 3 A voice of crying \add shall be\add* from Horonaim, spoiling and great
destruction. 
\v 4 Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard. 
\v 5 For in the going up of Luhith continual weeping shall go up; for in the
going down of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. 
\v 6 Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
\p
\v 7 For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou
shalt also be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity \add with
\add* his priests and his princes together. 
\v 8 And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape: the
valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed, as the LORD hath
spoken. 
\v 9 Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities
thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein. 
\v 10 Cursed \add be\add* he that doeth the work of the LORD deceitfully, and
cursed \add be\add* he that keepeth back his sword from blood.
\p
\v 11 Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees,
and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into
captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
\v 12 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto
him wanderers, that shall cause him to wander, and shall empty his vessels,
and break their bottles. 
\v 13 And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed
of Bethel their confidence.
\p
\v 14 How say ye, We \add are\add* mighty and strong men for the war? 
\v 15 Moab is spoiled, and gone up \add out of\add* her cities, and his chosen
young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name 
\add is\add* the LORD of hosts. 
\v 16 The calamity of Moab \add is\add* near to come, and his affliction
hasteth fast. 
\v 17 All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name,
say, How is the strong staff broken, \add and\add* the beautiful rod! 
\v 18 Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from \add thy
\add* glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab shall come upon thee,
\add and\add* he shall destroy thy strong holds. 
\v 19 O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy; ask him that fleeth,
and her that escapeth, \add and\add* say, What is done? 
\v 20 Moab is confounded; for it is broken down: howl and cry; and tell ye it
in Arnon, that Moab is spoiled, 
\v 21 And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon
Jahazah, and upon Mephaath, 
\v 22 And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim, 
\v 23 And upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon, 
\v 24 And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land
of Moab, far or near. 
\v 25 The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 26 Make ye him drunken: for he magnified \add himself\add* against the
LORD: Moab also shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision. 
\v 27 For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for
since thou spakest of him, thou skippedst for joy. 
\v 28 O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be
like the dove \add that\add* maketh her nest in the sides of the hole’s
mouth. 
\v 29 We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness,
and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. 
\v 30 I know his wrath, saith the LORD; but \add it shall\add* not \add be
\add* so; his lies shall not so effect \add it. \add*
\v 31 Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; 
\add mine heart\add* shall mourn for the men of Kir- heres. 
\v 32 O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer: thy
plants are gone over the sea, they reach \add even\add* to the sea of Jazer:
the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage. 
\v 33 And joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the
land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from the winepresses: none shall
tread with shouting; \add their\add* shouting \add shall be\add* no shouting.
\v 34 From the cry of Heshbon \add even\add* unto Elealeh, \add and even
\add* unto Jahaz, have they uttered their voice, from Zoar \add even
\add* unto Horonaim, \add as\add* an heifer of three years old: for the waters
also of Nimrim shall be desolate. 
\v 35 Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that
offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods. 
\v 36 Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and mine heart
shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: because the riches 
\add that\add* he hath gotten are perished. 
\v 37 For every head \add shall be\add* bald, and every beard clipped: upon
all the hands \add shall be\add* cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. 
\v 38 \add There shall be\add* lamentation generally upon all the housetops of
Moab, and in the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein
\add is\add* no pleasure, saith the LORD. 
\v 39 They shall howl, \add saying,\add* How is it broken down! how hath Moab
turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all
them about him. 
\v 40 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall
spread his wings over Moab. 
\v 41 Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the mighty
men’s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her
pangs. 
\v 42 And Moab shall be destroyed from \add being\add* a people, because he
hath magnified \add himself\add* against the LORD. 
\v 43 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, \add shall be\add* upon thee, O
inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD. 
\v 44 He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that
getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon
it, \add even\add* upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. 
\v 45 They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force:
but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of
Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the
tumultuous ones. 
\v 46 Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons
are taken captives, and thy daughters captives. 
\v 47 Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith
the LORD. Thus far \add is\add* the judgment of Moab.
\c 49
\p
\v 1 Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no sons? hath
he no heir? why \add then\add* doth their king inherit Gad, and his people
dwell in his cities? 
\v 2 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will cause an
alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it shall be a
desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire: then shall Israel
be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the LORD. 
\v 3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you
with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall
go into captivity, \add and\add* his priests and his princes together. 
\v 4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O backsliding
daughter? that trusted in her treasures, \add saying,\add* Who shall come unto
me? 
\v 5 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts, from
all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out every man right
forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth. 
\v 6 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children of Ammon,
saith the LORD.
\p
\v 7 Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; \add Is\add* wisdom no
more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom
vanished? 
\v 8 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring
the calamity of Esau upon him, the time \add that\add* I will visit him. 
\v 9 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave \add some
\add* gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have
enough. 
\v 10 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, and he
shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his brethren, and
his neighbours, and he is not. 
\v 11 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve \add them\add* alive; and
let thy widows trust in me. 
\v 12 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment \add was
\add* not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and \add art\add* thou
he \add that\add* shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go
unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink \add of it. \add*
\v 13 For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become a
desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall
be perpetual wastes. 
\v 14 I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent unto the
heathen, \add saying,\add* Gather ye together, and come against her, and rise
up to the battle. 
\v 15 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, \add and\add*
despised among men. 
\v 16 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, \add and\add* the pride of thine
heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the height
of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will
bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD. 
\v 17 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it shall be
astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof. 
\v 18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour \add cities
\add* thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall a son
of man dwell in it. 
\v 19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan against
the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make him run away from her:
and who \add is\add* a chosen \add man, that\add* I may appoint over her? for
who \add is\add* like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who 
\add is\add* that shepherd that will stand before me? 
\v 20 Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Edom;
and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman:
Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their
habitations desolate with them. 
\v 21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the noise
thereof was heard in the Red sea. 
\v 22 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his wings over
Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of Edom be as the
heart of a woman in her pangs.
\p
\v 23 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they have
heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; \add there is\add* sorrow on the
sea; it cannot be quiet. 
\v 24 Damascus is waxed feeble, \add and\add* turneth herself to flee, and
fear hath seized on \add her:\add* anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a
woman in travail. 
\v 25 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy! 
\v 26 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of
war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume
the palaces of Ben-hadad.
\p
\v 28 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise ye, go
up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. 
\v 29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall take to
themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels; and they
shall cry unto them, Fear \add is\add* on every side.
\p
\v 30 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the
LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, and
hath conceived a purpose against you. 
\v 31 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth without care,
saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, \add which\add* dwell
alone. 
\v 32 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a
spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them \add that are\add* in the utmost
corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof, saith the
LORD. 
\v 33 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, \add and\add* a desolation
for ever: there shall no man abide there, nor \add any\add* son of man dwell
in it.
\p
\v 34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against Elam in
the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying, 
\v 35 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, the
chief of their might. 
\v 36 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of
heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no
nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not come. 
\v 37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and before
them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them \add even
\add* my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them,
till I have consumed them: 
\v 38 And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence the king
and the princes, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 39 But it shall come to pass in the latter days, \add that\add* I will
bring again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.

\p
\v 1 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon \add and\add* against the
land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet. 
\v 2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard;
publish, \add and\add* conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded,
Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken
in pieces. 
\v 3 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall
make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they
shall depart, both man and beast.
\p
\v 4 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel
shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they
shall go, and seek the LORD their God. 
\v 5 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, \add saying,
\add* Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant 
\add that\add* shall not be forgotten. 
\v 6 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go
astray, they have turned them away \add on\add* the mountains: they have gone
from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace. 
\v 7 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We
offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of
justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers. 
\v 8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the
Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.
\p
\v 9 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of
great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array
against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows \add shall be
\add* as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain. 
\v 10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied,
saith the LORD. 
\v 11 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine
heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as
bulls; 
\v 12 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be
ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations \add shall be\add* a
wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. 
\v 13 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall
be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and
hiss at all her plagues. 
\v 14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend
the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.
\v 15 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations
are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it \add is\add* the vengeance of
the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. 
\v 16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the
time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to
his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
\p
\v 17 Israel \add is\add* a scattered sheep; the lions have driven \add him
\add* away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones. 
\v 18 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of
Assyria. 
\v 19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on
Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and
Gilead. 
\v 20 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel
shall be sought for, and \add there shall be\add* none; and the sins of Judah,
and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
\p
\v 21 Go up against the land of Merathaim, \add even\add* against it, and
against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith
the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. 
\v 22 A sound of battle \add is\add* in the land, and of great destruction. 
\v 23 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is
Babylon become a desolation among the nations! 
\v 24 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and
thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast
striven against the LORD. 
\v 25 The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of
his indignation: for this \add is\add* the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in
the land of the Chaldeans. 
\v 26 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her
up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. 
\v 27 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them!
for their day is come, the time of their visitation. 
\v 28 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to
declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his
temple. 
\v 29 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow,
camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according
to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath
been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 30 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of
war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD. 
\v 31 Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, \add O thou\add* most proud, saith
the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time \add that\add* I will
visit thee. 
\v 32 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up:
and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about
him.
\p
\v 33 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of
Judah \add were\add* oppressed together: and all that took them captives held
them fast; they refused to let them go. 
\v 34 Their Redeemer \add is\add* strong; the LORD of hosts \add is
\add* his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to
the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
\p
\v 35 A sword \add is\add* upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the
inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise \add men. 
\add*
\v 36 A sword \add is\add* upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword 
\add is\add* upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. 
\v 37 A sword \add is\add* upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and
upon all the mingled people that \add are\add* in the midst of her; and they
shall become as women: a sword \add is\add* upon her treasures; and they shall
be robbed. 
\v 38 A drought \add is\add* upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for
it \add is\add* the land of graven images, and they are mad upon \add their
\add* idols. 
\v 39 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the
islands shall dwell \add there,\add* and the owls shall dwell therein: and it
shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from
generation to generation. 
\v 40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour \add cities
\add* thereof, saith the LORD; \add so\add* shall no man abide there, neither
shall any son of man dwell therein. 
\v 41 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many
kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. 
\v 42 They shall hold the bow and the lance: they \add are\add* cruel, and
will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride
upon horses, \add every one\add* put in array, like a man to the battle,
against thee, O daughter of Babylon. 
\v 43 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed
feeble: anguish took hold of him, \add and\add* pangs as of a woman in
travail. 
\v 44 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto
the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her:
and who \add is\add* a chosen \add man, that\add* I may appoint over her? for
who \add is\add* like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who 
\add is\add* that shepherd that will stand before me? 
\v 45 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against
Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the
Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall
make \add their\add* habitation desolate with them. 
\v 46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is
heard among the nations.
\c 51
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against Babylon, and against
them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying
wind; 
\v 2 And will send unto Babylon fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty
her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about. 
\v 3 Against \add him that\add* bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and
against \add him that\add* lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye
not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host. 
\v 4 Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and \add they
that are\add* thrust through in her streets. 
\v 5 For Israel \add hath\add* not \add been\add* forsaken, nor Judah of his
God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the
Holy One of Israel. 
\v 6 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every man his soul: be not
cut off in her iniquity; for this \add is\add* the time of the LORD’S
vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence. 
\v 7 Babylon \add hath been\add* a golden cup in the LORD’S hand, that made
all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the
nations are mad. 
\v 8 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her
pain, if so she may be healed. 
\v 9 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let
us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven,
and is lifted up \add even\add* to the skies. 
\v 10 The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare
in Zion the work of the LORD our God. 
\v 11 Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the
spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device \add is\add* against Babylon,
to destroy it; because it \add is\add* the vengeance of the LORD, the
vengeance of his temple. 
\v 12 Set up the standard upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong,
set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and
done that which he spake against the inhabitants of Babylon. 
\v 13 O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end
is come, \add and\add* the measure of thy covetousness. 
\v 14 The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, \add saying,\add* Surely I will
fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout
against thee. 
\v 15 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by
his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. 
\v 16 When he uttereth \add his\add* voice, \add there is\add* a multitude of
waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of
the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of
his treasures. 
\v 17 Every man is brutish by \add his\add* knowledge; every founder is
confounded by the graven image: for his molten image \add is\add* falsehood,
and \add there is\add* no breath in them. 
\v 18 They \add are\add* vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their
visitation they shall perish. 
\v 19 The portion of Jacob \add is\add* not like them; for he \add is
\add* the former of all things: and \add Israel is\add* the rod of his
inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name. 
\v 20 Thou \add art\add* my battle axe \add and\add* weapons of war: for with
thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy
kingdoms; 
\v 21 And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with
thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; 
\v 22 With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will
I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the
young man and the maid; 
\v 23 I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and
with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with
thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers. 
\v 24 And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all
their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD. 
\v 25 Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the
LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon
thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain.
\v 26 And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for
foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD. 
\v 27 Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations,
prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of
Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses
to come up as the rough caterpillers. 
\v 28 Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the
captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his
dominion. 
\v 29 And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD
shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation
without an inhabitant. 
\v 30 The mighty men of Babylon have forborn to fight, they have remained in 
\add their\add* holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they
have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken. 
\v 31 One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another,
to shew the king of Babylon that his city is taken at \add one\add* end, 
\v 32 And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with
fire, and the men of war are affrighted. 
\v 33 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of
Babylon \add is\add* like a threshingfloor, \add it is\add* time to thresh
her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come. 
\v 34 Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me,
he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he
hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out. 
\v 35 The violence done to me and to my flesh \add be\add* upon Babylon, shall
the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea,
shall Jerusalem say. 
\v 36 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take
vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry. 
\v 37 And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for dragons, an
astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant. 
\v 38 They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions’ whelps. 
\v 39 In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken,
that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the
LORD. 
\v 40 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he
goats. 
\v 41 How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth
surprised! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the nations! 
\v 42 The sea is come up upon Babylon: she is covered with the multitude of
the waves thereof. 
\v 43 Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land
wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth \add any\add* son of man pass thereby. 
\v 44 And I will punish Bel in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his
mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together
any more unto him: yea, the wall of Babylon shall fall. 
\v 45 My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his
soul from the fierce anger of the LORD. 
\v 46 And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be
heard in the land; a rumour shall both come \add one\add* year, and after that
in \add another\add* year \add shall come\add* a rumour, and violence in the
land, ruler against ruler. 
\v 47 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the
graven images of Babylon: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her
slain shall fall in the midst of her. 
\v 48 Then the heaven and the earth, and all that \add is\add* therein, shall
sing for Babylon: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith
the LORD. 
\v 49 As Babylon \add hath caused\add* the slain of Israel to fall, so at
Babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth. 
\v 50 Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the
LORD afar off, and let Jerusalem come into your mind. 
\v 51 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered
our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD’S house. 
\v 52 Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do
judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall
groan. 
\v 53 Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify
the height of her strength, \add yet\add* from me shall spoilers come unto
her, saith the LORD. 
\v 54 A sound of a cry \add cometh\add* from Babylon, and great destruction
from the land of the Chaldeans: 
\v 55 Because the LORD hath spoiled Babylon, and destroyed out of her the
great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice
is uttered: 
\v 56 Because the spoiler is come upon her, \add even\add* upon Babylon, and
her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God
of recompences shall surely requite. 
\v 57 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise \add men,\add* her
captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual
sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name \add is\add* the LORD of
hosts. 
\v 58 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be
utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people
shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.
\p
\v 59 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah,
the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon
in the fourth year of his reign. And \add this\add* Seraiah was a quiet
prince. 
\v 60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon,
\add even\add* all these words that are written against Babylon. 
\v 61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt
see, and shalt read all these words; 
\v 62 Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut
it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall
be desolate for ever. 
\v 63 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, 
\add that\add* thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of
Euphrates: 
\v 64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the
evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far \add are
\add* the words of Jeremiah.
\c 52
\p
\v 1 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \add was\add* Hamutal
the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
\v 2 And he did \add that which was\add* evil in the eyes of the LORD,
according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 
\v 3 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah,
till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against
the king of Babylon.
\p
\v 4 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,
in the tenth day of the month, \add that\add* Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon
came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and
built forts against it round about. 
\v 5 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. 
\v 6 And in the fourth month, in the ninth \add day\add* of the month, the
famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the
land. 
\v 7 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth
out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which 
\add was\add* by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans \add were\add* by the
city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.
\p
\v 8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook
Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. 
\v 9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to
Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. 
\v 10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he
slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. 
\v 11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him
in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of
his death.
\p
\v 12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth \add day\add* of the month, which 
\add was\add* the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came
Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, \add which\add* served the king of
Babylon, into Jerusalem, 
\v 13 And burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the
houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great \add men,\add* burned he
with fire: 
\v 14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that \add were\add* with the captain
of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about. 
\v 15 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive 
\add certain\add* of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people
that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of
Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. 
\v 16 But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left \add certain\add* of the
poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen. 
\v 17 Also the pillars of brass that \add were\add* in the house of the LORD,
and the bases, and the brasen sea that \add was\add* in the house of the LORD,
the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. 
\v 18 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and
the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they
away. 
\v 19 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and
the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; \add that\add* which 
\add was\add* of gold \add in\add* gold, and \add that\add* which \add was
\add* of silver \add in\add* silver, took the captain of the guard away. 
\v 20 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that \add were
\add* under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD:
the brass of all these vessels was without weight. 
\v 21 And \add concerning\add* the pillars, the height of one pillar 
\add was\add* eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it;
and the thickness thereof \add was\add* four fingers: \add it was\add*
hollow. 
\v 22 And a chapiter of brass \add was\add* upon it; and the height of one
chapiter \add was\add* five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the
chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the
pomegranates \add were\add* like unto these. 
\v 23 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; \add and
\add* all the pomegranates upon the network \add were\add* an hundred round
about.
\p
\v 24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: 
\v 25 He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men
of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, which were
found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the
people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were
found in the midst of the city. 
\v 26 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to
the king of Babylon to Riblah. 
\v 27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in
the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land. 
\v 28 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the
seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: 
\v 29 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from
Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: 
\v 30 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar- adan the
captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and
five persons: all the persons \add were\add* four thousand and six hundred.
\p
\v 31 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of
Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth 
\add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* Evil-merodach king of Babylon in
the \add first\add* year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of
Judah, and brought him forth out of prison, 
\v 32 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the
kings that \add were\add* with him in Babylon, 
\v 33 And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before
him all the days of his life. 
\v 34 And \add for\add* his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the
king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days
of his life.
