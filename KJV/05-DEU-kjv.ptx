\h Deuteronomy
\mt The Fifth Book of Moses, called Deuteronomy 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 These \add be\add* the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this
side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red \add sea,
\add* between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab. 
\v 2 (\add There are\add* eleven days’ \add journey\add* from Horeb by the way
of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.) 
\v 3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the
first \add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* Moses spake unto the children
of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto
them; 
\v 4 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in
Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei: 
\v 5 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this
law, saying, 
\v 6 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long
enough in this mount: 
\v 7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and
unto all \add the places\add* nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and
in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the
Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates. 
\v 8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which
the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them
and to their seed after them.
\p
\v 9 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you
myself alone: 
\v 10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye \add are
\add* this day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
\v 11 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as
ye \add are,\add* and bless you, as he hath promised you!) 
\v 12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your
strife? 
\v 13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I
will make them rulers over you. 
\v 14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good 
\add for us\add* to do. 
\v 15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them
heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and
captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your
tribes. 
\v 16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear \add the causes
\add* between your brethren, and judge righteously between \add every
\add* man and his brother, and the stranger \add that is\add* with him. 
\v 17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; \add but \add*ye shall hear
the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for
the judgment \add is \add*God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring
\add it \add*unto me, and I will hear it. 
\v 18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
\p
\v 19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and
terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites,
as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. 
\v 20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites,
which the LORD our God doth give unto us. 
\v 21 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up 
\add and\add* possess \add it,\add* as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said
unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.
\p
\v 22 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men
before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by
what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come. 
\v 23 and the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a
tribe: 
\v 24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley
of Eshcol, and searched it out. 
\v 25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought 
\add it\add* down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, \add It is
\add* a good land which the LORD our God doth give us. 
\v 26 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment
of the LORD your God: 
\v 27 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he
hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of
the Amorites, to destroy us. 
\v 28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying,
The people \add is\add* greater and taller than we; the cities \add are
\add* great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the
Anakims there. 
\v 29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them. 
\v 30 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,
according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes; 
\v 31 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God
bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye
came into this place. 
\v 32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God, 
\v 33 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your
tents \add in,\add* in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go,
and in a cloud by day. 
\v 34 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware,
saying, 
\v 35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that
good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, 
\v 36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give
the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath
wholly followed the LORD. 
\v 37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt
not go in thither. 
\v 38 \add But\add* Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he
shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
\v 39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your
children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall
go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it. 
\v 40 But \add as for\add* you, turn you, and take your journey into the
wilderness by the way of the Red sea. 
\v 41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we
will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And
when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up
into the hill. 
\v 42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for
I \add am\add* not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies. 
\v 43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the
commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill. 
\v 44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you,
and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, \add even\add* unto
Hormah. 
\v 45 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken
to your voice, nor give ear unto you. 
\v 46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode 
\add there.\add*
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of
the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many
days. 
\v 2 And the LORD spake unto me, saying, 
\v 3 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward. 
\v 4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye \add are\add* to pass through the
coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they
shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore: 
\v 5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so
much as a footbreadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau \add for
\add* a possession. 
\v 6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also
buy water of them for money, that ye may drink. 
\v 7 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he
knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD
thy God \add hath been\add* with thee; thou hast lacked nothing. 
\v 8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt
in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we
turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab. 
\v 9 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend
with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land \add for
\add* a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot 
\add for\add* a possession. 
\v 10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and
tall, as the Anakims; 
\v 11 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call
them Emims. 
\v 12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau
succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in
their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD
gave unto them. 
\v 13 Now rise up, \add said I,\add* and get you over the brook Zered. And we
went over the brook Zered. 
\v 14 And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come
over the brook Zered, \add was\add* thirty and eight years; until all the
generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD
sware unto them. 
\v 15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from
among the host, until they were consumed.
\p
\v 16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from
among the people, 
\v 17 That the LORD spake unto me, saying, 
\v 18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day: 
\v 19 And \add when\add* thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land
of the children of Ammon \add any\add* possession; because I have given it
unto the children of Lot \add for\add* a possession. 
\v 20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old
time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims; 
\v 21 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD
destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their
stead: 
\v 22 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he
destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in
their stead even unto this day: 
\v 23 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, \add even\add* unto Azzah, the
Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in
their stead.)
\p
\v 24 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I
have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land:
begin to possess \add it,\add* and contend with him in battle. 
\v 25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon
the nations \add that are\add* under the whole heaven, who shall hear report
of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
\p
\v 26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king
of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 
\v 27 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will
neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left. 
\v 28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for
money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet; 
\v 29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which
dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which
the LORD our God giveth us. 
\v 30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy
God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver
him into thy hand, as \add appeareth\add* this day. 
\v 31 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his
land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land. 
\v 32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at
Jahaz. 
\v 33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his
sons, and all his people. 
\v 34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men,
and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain: 
\v 35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the
cities which we took. 
\v 36 From Aroer, which \add is\add* by the brink of the river of Arnon, and 
\add from\add* the city that \add is\add* by the river, even unto Gilead,
there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto
us: 
\v 37 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto
any place of the river Jabbok, \add nor\add* unto the cities in the mountains,
nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan
came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 
\v 2 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all
his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou
didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 
\v 3 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan,
and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining. 
\v 4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we
took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of
Og in Bashan. 
\v 5 All these cities \add were\add* fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
beside unwalled towns a great many. 
\v 6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon,
utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city. 
\v 7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to
ourselves. 
\v 8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites
the land that \add was\add* on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto
mount Hermon; 
\v 9 (\add Which\add* Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call
it Shenir;) 
\v 10 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto
Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
\v 11 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold,
his bedstead \add was\add* a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the
children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four cubits the
breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. 
\v 12 And this land, \add which\add* we possessed at that time, from Aroer,
which \add is\add* by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities
thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 
\v 13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, \add being\add* the kingdom of
Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all
Bashan, which was called the land of giants. 
\v 14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts
of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-
havoth-jair, unto this day. 
\v 15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir. 
\v 16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even
unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river
Jabbok, \add which is\add* the border of the children of Ammon; 
\v 17 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast \add thereof,\add* from
Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, \add even\add* the salt sea, under
Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.
\p
\v 18 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given
you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the
children of Israel, all \add that are\add* meet for the war. 
\v 19 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (\add for
\add* I know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I
have given you; 
\v 20 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto you,
and \add until\add* they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath
given them beyond Jordan: and \add then\add* shall ye return every man unto
his possession, which I have given you.
\p
\v 21 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all
that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do
unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest. 
\v 22 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you. 
\v 23 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying, 
\v 24 O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy
mighty hand: for what God \add is there\add* in heaven or in earth, that can
do according to thy works, and according to thy might? 
\v 25 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that \add is
\add* beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 
\v 26 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me:
and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this
matter. 
\v 27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and
northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold \add it\add* with thine
eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
\v 28 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall
go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which
thou shalt see. 
\v 29 So we abode in the valley over against Beth- peor.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto the
judgments, which I teach you, for to do \add them,\add* that ye may live, and
go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers giveth you. 
\v 2 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye
diminish \add ought\add* from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the
LORD your God which I command you. 
\v 3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the
men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among
you. 
\v 4 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God \add are\add* alive every
one of you this day. 
\v 5 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God
commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it. 
\v 6 Keep therefore and do \add them;\add* for this \add is\add* your wisdom
and your understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear all these
statutes, and say, Surely this great nation \add is\add* a wise and
understanding people. 
\v 7 For what nation \add is there so\add* great, who \add hath\add* God 
\add so\add* nigh unto them, as the LORD our God \add is\add* in all 
\add things that\add* we call upon him \add for? \add*
\v 8 And what nation \add is there so\add* great, that hath statutes and
judgments \add so\add* righteous as all this law, which I set before you this
day? 
\v 9 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget
the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all
the days of thy life: but teach them thy sons, and thy sons’ sons; 
\v 10 \add Specially\add* the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God
in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people together, and I
will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that
they shall live upon the earth, and \add that\add* they may teach their
children. 
\v 11 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned
with fire unto the midst of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick
darkness. 
\v 12 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye heard the
voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only \add ye heard\add* a voice. 
\v 13 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to
perform, \add even\add* ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of
stone.
\p
\v 14 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess
it. 
\v 15 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no manner of
similitude on the day \add that\add* the LORD spake unto you in Horeb out of
the midst of the fire: 
\v 16 Lest ye corrupt \add yourselves,\add* and make you a graven image, the
similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 
\v 17 The likeness of any beast that \add is\add* on the earth, the likeness
of any winged fowl that flieth in the air, 
\v 18 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the likeness of
any fish that \add is\add* in the waters beneath the earth: 
\v 19 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the
sun, and the moon, and the stars, \add even\add* all the host of heaven,
shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD thy God
hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven. 
\v 20 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron
furnace, \add even\add* out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of inheritance,
as \add ye are\add* this day. 
\v 21 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and sware that I
should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in unto that good land,
which the LORD thy God giveth thee \add for\add* an inheritance: 
\v 22 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye shall go
over, and possess that good land. 
\v 23 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the LORD your
God, which he made with you, and make you a graven image, \add or\add* the
likeness of any \add thing,\add* which the LORD thy God hath forbidden thee. 
\v 24 For the LORD thy God \add is\add* a consuming fire, \add even
\add* a jealous God.
\p
\v 25 When thou shalt beget children, and children’s children, and ye shall
have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt \add yourselves,\add* and
make a graven image, \add or\add* the likeness of any \add thing,\add* and
shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to provoke him to anger: 
\v 26 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall
soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over Jordan to possess
it; ye shall not prolong \add your\add* days upon it, but shall utterly be
destroyed. 
\v 27 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall be left
few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD shall lead you. 
\v 28 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone,
which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
\v 29 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou shalt find 
\add him,\add* if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul. 
\v 30 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come upon thee, 
\add even\add* in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD thy God, and shalt
be obedient unto his voice; 
\v 31 (For the LORD thy God \add is\add* a merciful God;) he will not forsake
thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he
sware unto them. 
\v 32 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the
day that God created man upon the earth, and \add ask\add* from the one side
of heaven unto the other, whether there hath been \add any such thing
\add* as this great thing \add is,\add* or hath been heard like it? 
\v 33 Did \add ever\add* people hear the voice of God speaking out of the
midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live? 
\v 34 Or hath God assayed to go \add and\add* take him a nation from the midst
of another \add nation,\add* by temptations, by signs, and by wonders, and by
war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm, and by great terrors,
according to all that the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your
eyes? 
\v 35 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD he 
\add is\add* God; \add there is\add* none else beside him. 
\v 36 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might instruct
thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire; and thou heardest his
words out of the midst of the fire. 
\v 37 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after
them, and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt; 
\v 38 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou 
\add art,\add* to bring thee in, to give thee their land \add for\add* an
inheritance, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 39 Know therefore this day, and consider \add it\add* in thine heart, that
the LORD he \add is\add* God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: 
\add there is\add* none else. 
\v 40 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments, which I
command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children
after thee, and that thou mayest prolong \add thy\add* days upon the earth,
which the LORD thy God giveth thee, for ever.
\p
\v 41 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
sunrising; 
\v 42 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbour
unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that fleeing unto one of these
cities he might live: 
\v 43 \add Namely,\add* Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the
Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, of the
Manassites.
\p
\v 44 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel: 
\v 45 These \add are\add* the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel, after they came
forth out of Egypt, 
\v 46 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Beth-peor, in the land
of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the
children of Israel smote, after they were come forth out of Egypt: 
\v 47 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Bashan, two
kings of the Amorites, which \add were\add* on this side Jordan toward the
sunrising; 
\v 48 From Aroer, which \add is\add* by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto
mount Sion, which \add is\add* Hermon, 
\v 49 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the
plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the
statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn
them, and keep, and do them. 
\v 2 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. 
\v 3 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us, 
\add even\add* us, who \add are\add* all of us here alive this day. 
\v 4 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of
the fire, 
\v 5 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you the word of
the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the fire, and went not up into the
mount;) saying,
\p
\v 6 I \add am\add* the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
\v 7 Thou shalt have none other gods before me. 
\v 8 Thou shalt not make thee \add any\add* graven image, \add or\add* any
likeness \add of any thing\add* that \add is\add* in heaven above, or that 
\add is\add* in the earth beneath, or that \add is\add* in the waters beneath
the earth: 
\v 9 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for I the LORD
thy God \add am\add* a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon
the children unto the third and fourth \add generation\add* of them that hate
me, 
\v 10 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my
commandments. 
\v 11 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for the LORD
will not hold \add him\add* guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 
\v 12 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath commanded
thee. 
\v 13 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work: 
\v 14 But the seventh day \add is\add* the sabbath of the LORD thy God: 
\add in it\add* thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine ox, nor thine
ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger that \add is\add* within thy
gates; that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou. 
\v 15 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and 
\add that\add* the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand
and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy God commanded thee to keep
the sabbath day.
\p
\v 16 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath commanded
thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee, in
the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 
\v 17 Thou shalt not kill. 
\v 18 Neither shalt thou commit adultery. 
\v 19 Neither shalt thou steal. 
\v 20 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
\v 21 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour’s wife, neither shalt thou covet
thy neighbour’s house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his
ox, or his ass, or any \add thing\add* that \add is\add* thy neighbour’s.
\p
\v 22 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of
the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great
voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and
delivered them unto me. 
\v 23 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the
darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that ye came near unto me, 
\add even\add* all the heads of your tribes, and your elders; 
\v 24 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory and his
greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have
seen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth. 
\v 25 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will consume us: if
we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more, then we shall die. 
\v 26 For who \add is there of\add* all flesh, that hath heard the voice of
the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we \add have,
\add* and lived? 
\v 27 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say: and speak
thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak unto thee; and we will hear
\add it,\add* and do \add it. \add*
\v 28 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto me; and
the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people,
which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have
spoken. 
\v 29 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and
keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with
their children for ever! 
\v 30 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again. 
\v 31 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all
the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach
them, that they may do \add them\add* in the land which I give them to possess
it. 
\v 32 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded
you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 
\v 33 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath commanded
you, that ye may live, and \add that it may be\add* well with you, and 
\add that\add* ye may prolong \add your\add* days in the land which ye shall
possess.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the commandments, the statutes, and the
judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do 
\add them\add* in the land whither ye go to possess it: 
\v 2 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his statutes and
his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son,
all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.
\p
\v 3 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do \add it;\add* that it may be
well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD God of thy
fathers hath promised thee, in the land that floweth with milk and honey. 
\v 4 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God \add is\add* one LORD: 
\v 5 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy might. 
\v 6 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart:
\v 7 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of
them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and
when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 
\v 8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as
frontlets between thine eyes. 
\v 9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.
\v 10 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the
land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to
give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not, 
\v 11 And houses full of all good \add things,\add* which thou filledst not,
and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive trees, which
thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten and be full; 
\v 12 \add Then\add* beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee
forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
\v 13 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his
name. 
\v 14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which 
\add are\add* round about you; 
\v 15 (For the LORD thy God \add is\add* a jealous God among you) lest the
anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from off
the face of the earth.
\p
\v 16 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted \add him\add* in
Massah. 
\v 17 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his
testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee. 
\v 18 And thou shalt do \add that which is\add* right and good in the sight of
the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and
possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, 
\v 19 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath
spoken. 
\v 20 \add And\add* when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What 
\add mean\add* the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments, which the
LORD our God hath commanded you? 
\v 21 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt;
and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand: 
\v 22 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon
Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes: 
\v 23 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in, to give us
the land which he sware unto our fathers. 
\v 24 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our
God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as \add it is
\add* at this day. 
\v 25 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these
commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath commanded us.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest
to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and
the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and
the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;
\v 2 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt
smite them, \add and\add* utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant
with them, nor shew mercy unto them: 
\v 3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not
give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. 
\v 4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve
other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy
thee suddenly. 
\v 5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and
break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven
images with fire. 
\v 6 For thou \add art\add* an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy
God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people
that \add are\add* upon the face of the earth. 
\v 7 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were
more in number than any people; for ye \add were\add* the fewest of all
people: 
\v 8 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which
he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty
hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh
king of Egypt. 
\v 9 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he \add is\add* God, the faithful
God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his
commandments to a thousand generations; 
\v 10 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will
not be slack to him that hateth him, he will repay him to his face. 
\v 11 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the
judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.
\p
\v 12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and
keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and
the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers: 
\v 13 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he will also
bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy
wine, and thine oil, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in
the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee. 
\v 14 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be male or
female barren among you, or among your cattle. 
\v 15 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will put none of
the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest, upon thee; but will lay them
upon all \add them\add* that hate thee. 
\v 16 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall
deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve
their gods; for that \add will be\add* a snare unto thee. 
\v 17 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations \add are\add* more than
I; how can I dispossess them? 
\v 18 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: \add but\add* shalt well remember what
the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt; 
\v 19 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the
wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy
God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom
thou art afraid. 
\v 20 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they
that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed. 
\v 21 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God \add is
\add* among you, a mighty God and terrible. 
\v 22 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by little
and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest the beasts of the field
increase upon thee. 
\v 23 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy
them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed. 
\v 24 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou shalt destroy
their name from under heaven: there shall no man be able to stand before thee,
until thou have destroyed them. 
\v 25 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou shalt not
desire the silver or gold \add that is\add* on them, nor take \add it
\add* unto thee, lest thou be snared therein: for it \add is\add* an
abomination to the LORD thy God. 
\v 26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a
cursed thing like it: \add but\add* thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou
shalt utterly abhor it; for it \add is\add* a cursed thing.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe to
do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the
LORD sware unto your fathers. 
\v 2 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led thee these
forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, \add and\add* to prove thee, to
know what \add was\add* in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his
commandments, or no. 
\v 3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with
manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might
make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every \add word
\add* that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live. 
\v 4 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these
forty years. 
\v 5 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man chasteneth his
son, \add so\add* the LORD thy God chasteneth thee. 
\v 6 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, to walk
in his ways, and to fear him. 
\v 7 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of
water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills; 
\v 8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates;
a land of oil olive, and honey; 
\v 9 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou shalt not
lack any \add thing\add* in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose
hills thou mayest dig brass. 
\v 10 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the LORD thy
God for the good land which he hath given thee. 
\v 11 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping his
commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I command thee this
day: 
\v 12 Lest \add when\add* thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly
houses, and dwelt \add therein; \add*
\v 13 And \add when\add* thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and
thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied; 
\v 14 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy God, which
brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; 
\v 15 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness, \add wherein
were\add* fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where \add there was
\add* no water; who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint; 
\v 16 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers knew not,
that he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at
thy latter end; 
\v 17 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of \add mine
\add* hand hath gotten me this wealth. 
\v 18 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for \add it is\add* he that
giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he
sware unto thy fathers, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 19 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk
after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this
day that ye shall surely perish. 
\v 20 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so shall ye
perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the LORD your God.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Hear, O Israel: Thou \add art\add* to pass over Jordan this day, to go in
to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced
up to heaven, 
\v 2 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest,
and \add of whom\add* thou hast heard \add say,\add* Who can stand before the
children of Anak! 
\v 3 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God \add is\add* he
which goeth over before thee; \add as\add* a consuming fire he shall destroy
them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them
out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee. 
\v 4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them
out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in
to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth
drive them out from before thee. 
\v 5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost
thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the
LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the
word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
\v 6 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good
land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou \add art\add* a stiffnecked
people.
\p
\v 7 Remember, \add and\add* forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God
to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the
land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against
the LORD. 
\v 8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry
with you to have destroyed you. 
\v 9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, 
\add even\add* the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I
abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor
drink water: 
\v 10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the
finger of God; and on them \add was written\add* according to all the words,
which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the
day of the assembly. 
\v 11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, 
\add that\add* the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, \add even\add* the
tables of the covenant. 
\v 12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for
thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted 
\add themselves;\add* they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I
commanded them; they have made them a molten image. 
\v 13 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people,
and, behold, it \add is\add* a stiffnecked people: 
\v 14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from
under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than
they. 
\v 15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with
fire: and the two tables of the covenant \add were\add* in my two hands. 
\v 16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, 
\add and\add* had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of
the way which the LORD had commanded you. 
\v 17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake
them before your eyes. 
\v 18 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty
nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins
which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to
anger. 
\v 19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD
was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that
time also. 
\v 20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I
prayed for Aaron also the same time. 
\v 21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire,
and stamped it, \add and\add* ground \add it\add* very small, \add even
\add* until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the
brook that descended out of the mount. 
\v 22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the
LORD to wrath. 
\v 23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and
possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the
commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to
his voice. 
\v 24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you. 
\v 25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell
down \add at the first;\add* because the LORD had said he would destroy you. 
\v 26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy
people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness,
which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 
\v 27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the
stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin: 
\v 28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was
not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he
hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness. 
\v 29 Yet they \add are\add* thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like
unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of
wood. 
\v 2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables
which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark. 
\v 3 And I made an ark \add of\add* shittim wood, and hewed two tables of
stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables
in mine hand. 
\v 4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten
commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of
the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me. 
\v 5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in
the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.
\p
\v 6 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the
children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and
Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead. 
\v 7 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a
land of rivers of waters.
\p
\v 8 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the
covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister unto him, and to
bless in his name, unto this day. 
\v 9 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the LORD 
\add is\add* his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God promised him. 
\v 10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and
forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, \add and
\add* the LORD would not destroy thee. 
\v 11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take \add thy\add* journey before the
people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their
fathers to give unto them.
\p
\v 12 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear
the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the
LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, 
\v 13 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which I command
thee this day for thy good? 
\v 14 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens \add is\add* the LORD’S thy
God, the earth \add also,\add* with all that therein \add is. \add*
\v 15 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose
their seed after them, \add even\add* you above all people, as \add it is
\add* this day. 
\v 16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more
stiffnecked. 
\v 17 For the LORD your God \add is\add* God of gods, and Lord of lords, a
great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh
reward: 
\v 18 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the
stranger, in giving him food and raiment. 
\v 19 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of
Egypt. 
\v 20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt
thou cleave, and swear by his name. 
\v 21 He \add is\add* thy praise, and he \add is\add* thy God, that hath done
for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen. 
\v 22 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and
now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his charge, and his
statutes, and his judgments, and his commandments, alway. 
\v 2 And know ye this day: for \add I speak\add* not with your children which
have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God,
his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, 
\v 3 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto
Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land; 
\v 4 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and to their
chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they
pursued after you, and \add how\add* the LORD hath destroyed them unto this
day; 
\v 5 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into this
place; 
\v 6 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of
Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their
households, and their tents, and all the substance that \add was\add* in their
possession, in the midst of all Israel: 
\v 7 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did. 
\v 8 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command you this
day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land, whither ye go to
possess it; 
\v 9 And that ye may prolong \add your\add* days in the land, which the LORD
sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a land that
floweth with milk and honey.
\p
\v 10 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, \add is\add* not as
the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst thy seed, and
wateredst \add it\add* with thy foot, as a garden of herbs: 
\v 11 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, \add is\add* a land of hills
\add and\add* valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven: 
\v 12 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD thy God 
\add are\add* always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end
of the year.
\p
\v 13 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my
commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to
serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, 
\v 14 That I will give \add you\add* the rain of your land in his due season,
the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and
thy wine, and thine oil. 
\v 15 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat
and be full. 
\v 16 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn
aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; 
\v 17 And \add then\add* the LORD’S wrath be kindled against you, and he shut
up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit;
and \add lest\add* ye perish quickly from off the good land which the LORD
giveth you.
\p
\v 18 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul,
and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as frontlets between
your eyes. 
\v 19 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou
sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest
down, and when thou risest up. 
\v 20 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon
thy gates: 
\v 21 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the
land which the LORD sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of
heaven upon the earth.
\p
\v 22 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command
you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in all his ways, and to
cleave unto him; 
\v 23 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before you, and ye
shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves. 
\v 24 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours:
from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even
unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be. 
\v 25 There shall no man be able to stand before you: \add for\add* the LORD
your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that
ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you.
\p
\v 26 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; 
\v 27 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I
command you this day: 
\v 28 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other
gods, which ye have not known. 
\v 29 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought thee in
unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that thou shalt put the
blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. 
\v 30 \add Are\add* they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the
sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the champaign
over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh? 
\v 31 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land which the
LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. 
\v 32 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which I set
before you this day.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 These \add are\add* the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to
do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it,
all the days that ye live upon the earth. 
\v 2 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye
shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills,
and under every green tree: 
\v 3 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn
their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods,
and destroy the names of them out of that place. 
\v 4 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God. 
\v 5 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of all your
tribes to put his name there, \add even\add* unto his habitation shall ye
seek, and thither thou shalt come: 
\v 6 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and
your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your
freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks: 
\v 7 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall rejoice in
all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your households, wherein the LORD thy
God hath blessed thee. 
\v 8 Ye shall not do after all \add the things\add* that we do here this day,
every man whatsoever \add is\add* right in his own eyes. 
\v 9 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the
LORD your God giveth you. 
\v 10 But \add when\add* ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the
LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and \add when\add* he giveth you rest
from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; 
\v 11 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to
cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you;
your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering
of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD: 
\v 12 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your sons, and
your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite
that \add is\add* within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor
inheritance with you. 
\v 13 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every
place that thou seest: 
\v 14 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy tribes, there
thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there thou shalt do all that I
command thee. 
\v 15 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates,
whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the LORD thy
God which he hath given thee: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of
the roebuck, and as of the hart. 
\v 16 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as
water.
\p
\v 17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy
wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any
of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering
of thine hand: 
\v 18 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place which the
LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy
manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that \add is\add* within thy
gates: and thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest
thine hands unto. 
\v 19 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long as thou
livest upon the earth.
\p
\v 20 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath promised
thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because thy soul longeth to eat
flesh; thou mayest eat flesh, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 
\v 21 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his name there be
too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock, which
the LORD hath given thee, as I have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy
gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after. 
\v 22 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them: the
unclean and the clean shall eat \add of\add* them alike. 
\v 23 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood \add is
\add* the life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh. 
\v 24 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water. 
\v 25 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with thy
children after thee, when thou shalt do \add that which is\add* right in the
sight of the LORD. 
\v 26 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt take, and
go unto the place which the LORD shall choose: 
\v 27 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon
the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured
out upon the altar of the LORD thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh. 
\v 28 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it may go
well with thee, and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest 
\add that which is\add* good and right in the sight of the LORD thy God.
\p
\v 29 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee,
whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in
their land; 
\v 30 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them, after
that they be destroyed from before thee; and that thou enquire not after their
gods, saying, How did these nations serve their gods? even so will I do
likewise. 
\v 31 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every abomination to the
LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto their gods; for even their sons and
their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods. 
\v 32 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt not add
thereto, nor diminish from it.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth
thee a sign or a wonder, 
\v 2 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee,
saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us
serve them; 
\v 3 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of
dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know whether ye love the LORD
your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 
\v 4 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep his
commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto
him. 
\v 5 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death;
because he hath spoken to turn \add you\add* away from the LORD your God,
which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house
of bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the LORD thy God commanded
thee to walk in. So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.
\p
\v 6 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy daughter, or
the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which \add is\add* as thine own soul,
entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou hast
not known, thou, nor thy fathers; 
\v 7 \add Namely,\add* of the gods of the people which \add are\add* round
about you, nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the \add one\add* end of
the earth even unto the \add other\add* end of the earth; 
\v 8 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall
thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him:
\v 9 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to put
him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 
\v 10 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he hath
sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of
the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage. 
\v 11 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such
wickedness as this is among you.
\p
\v 12 If thou shalt hear \add say\add* in one of thy cities, which the LORD
thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying, 
\v 13 \add Certain\add* men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among
you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and
serve other gods, which ye have not known; 
\v 14 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently; and,
behold, \add if it be\add* truth, \add and\add* the thing certain, \add that
\add* such abomination is wrought among you; 
\v 15 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of
the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that \add is\add* therein, and the
cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword. 
\v 16 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street
thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every
whit, for the LORD thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be
built again. 
\v 17 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand: that
the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger, and shew thee mercy, and
have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy
fathers; 
\v 18 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep all
his commandments which I command thee this day, to do \add that which is
\add* right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Ye \add are\add* the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut
yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead. 
\v 2 for thou \add art\add* an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the LORD
hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself, above all the nations
that \add are\add* upon the earth.
\p
\v 3 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing. 
\v 4 These \add are\add* the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and
the goat, 
\v 5 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild goat, and
the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois. 
\v 6 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft into two
claws, \add and\add* cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye shall eat. 
\v 7 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, or of them
that divide the cloven hoof; \add as\add* the camel, and the hare, and the
coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; \add therefore
\add* they \add are\add* unclean unto you. 
\v 8 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it
is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead
carcase.
\p
\v 9 These ye shall eat of all that \add are\add* in the waters: all that have
fins and scales shall ye eat: 
\v 10 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it \add is
\add* unclean unto you.
\p
\v 11 \add Of\add* all clean birds ye shall eat. 
\v 12 But these \add are they\add* of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and
ossifrage, and the ospray, 
\v 13 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind, 
\v 14 And every raven after his kind, 
\v 15 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk after his
kind, 
\v 16 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan, 
\v 17 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant, 
\v 18 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and the
bat. 
\v 19 And every creeping thing that flieth \add is\add* unclean unto you: they
shall not be eaten. 
\v 20 \add But of\add* all clean fowls ye may eat.
\p
\v 21 Ye shall not eat \add of\add* any thing that dieth of itself: thou shalt
give it unto the stranger that \add is\add* in thy gates, that he may eat it;
or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou \add art\add* an holy people
unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk. 
\v 22 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the field
bringeth forth year by year. 
\v 23 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which he shall
choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of
thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest
learn to fear the LORD thy God always. 
\v 24 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry
it; \add or\add* if the place be too far from thee, which the LORD thy God
shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD thy God hath blessed thee: 
\v 25 Then shalt thou turn \add it\add* into money, and bind up the money in
thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: 
\v 26 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after,
for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatsoever
thy soul desireth: and thou shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou
shalt rejoice, thou, and thine household, 
\v 27 And the Levite that \add is\add* within thy gates; thou shalt not
forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.
\p
\v 28 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine
increase the same year, and shalt lay \add it\add* up within thy gates: 
\v 29 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee,) and
the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which \add are\add* within
thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD thy God
may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 At the end of \add every\add* seven years thou shalt make a release. 
\v 2 And this \add is\add* the manner of the release: Every creditor that
lendeth \add ought\add* unto his neighbour shall release \add it;\add* he
shall not exact \add it\add* of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it
is called the LORD’S release. 
\v 3 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact \add it again:\add* but \add that
\add* which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release; 
\v 4 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall greatly
bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee \add for\add* an
inheritance to possess it: 
\v 5 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to
observe to do all these commandments which I command thee this day. 
\v 6 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt
lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over
many nations,but they shall not reign over thee.
\p
\v 7 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy
gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not harden
thine heart, nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother: 
\v 8 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely lend him
sufficient for his need, \add in that\add* which he wanteth. 
\v 9 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart, saying, The
seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against
thy poor brother, and thou givest him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against
thee, and it be sin unto thee. 
\v 10 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when
thou givest unto him: because that for this thing the LORD thy God shall bless
thee in all thy works, and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto. 
\v 11 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command
thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor,
and to thy needy, in thy land.
\p
\v 12 \add And\add* if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold
unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year thou shalt let
him go free from thee. 
\v 13 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go
away empty: 
\v 14 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of thy floor,
and out of thy winepress: \add of that\add* wherewith the LORD thy God hath
blessed thee thou shalt give unto him. 
\v 15 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt,
and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I command thee this thing to
day. 
\v 16 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from thee;
because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is well with thee; 
\v 17 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust \add it\add* through his ear
unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also unto thy
maidservant thou shalt do likewise. 
\v 18 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away free from
thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant \add to thee,\add* in
serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all that thou
doest.
\p
\v 19 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou
shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no work with the firstling
of thy bullock, nor shear the firstling of thy sheep. 
\v 20 Thou shalt eat \add it\add* before the LORD thy God year by year in the
place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household. 
\v 21 And if there be \add any\add* blemish therein, \add as if it be
\add* lame, or blind, \add or have\add* any ill blemish, thou shalt not
sacrifice it unto the LORD thy God. 
\v 22 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean 
\add person shall eat it\add* alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart. 
\v 23 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the
ground as water.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God:
for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by
night. 
\v 2 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy God, of the
flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name
there. 
\v 3 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat
unleavened bread therewith, \add even\add* the bread of affliction; for thou
camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the
day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
\v 4 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast
seven days; neither shall there \add any thing\add* of the flesh, which thou
sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning. 
\v 5 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the
LORD thy God giveth thee: 
\v 6 But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name
in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the
sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt. 
\v 7 And thou shalt roast and eat \add it\add* in the place which the LORD thy
God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents. 
\v 8 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day 
\add shall be\add* a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no
work \add therein.\add*
\p
\v 9 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the seven weeks
from \add such time as\add* thou beginnest \add to put\add* the sickle to the
corn. 
\v 10 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God with a
tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which thou shalt give 
\add unto the LORD thy God,\add* according as the LORD thy God hath blessed
thee: 
\v 11 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and
thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite that 
\add is\add* within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the
widow, that \add are\add* among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath
chosen to place his name there. 
\v 12 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou
shalt observe and do these statutes.
\p
\v 13 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou
hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine: 
\v 14 And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy
daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the Levite, the
stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that \add are\add* within thy
gates. 
\v 15 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy God in the
place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee
in all thine increase, and in all the works of thine hands, therefore thou
shalt surely rejoice.
\p
\v 16 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God
in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in
the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear
before the LORD empty: 
\v 17 Every man \add shall give\add* as he is able, according to the blessing
of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.
\p
\v 18 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the
LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the
people with just judgment. 
\v 19 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither
take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words
of the righteous. 
\v 20 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live,
and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.
\p
\v 21 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of
the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee. 
\v 22 Neither shalt thou set thee up \add any\add* image; which the LORD thy
God hateth.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God \add any\add* bullock, or
sheep, wherein is blemish, \add or\add* any evilfavouredness: for that 
\add is\add* an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
\p
\v 2 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the LORD thy
God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of
the LORD thy God, in transgressing his covenant, 
\v 3 And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun,
or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded; 
\v 4 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard \add of it,\add* and enquired
diligently, and, behold, \add it be\add* true, \add and\add* the thing
certain, \add that\add* such abomination is wrought in Israel: 
\v 5 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have committed
that wicked thing, unto thy gates, \add even\add* that man or that woman, and
shalt stone them with stones, till they die. 
\v 6 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is
worthy of death be put to death; \add but\add* at the mouth of one witness he
shall not be put to death. 
\v 7 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death,
and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away
from among you.
\p
\v 8 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and
blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, \add being
\add* matters of controversy within thy gates: then shalt thou arise, and get
thee up into the place which the LORD thy God shall choose; 
\v 9 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the judge that
shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall shew thee the sentence of
judgment: 
\v 10 And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of that place
which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and thou shalt observe to do
according to all that they inform thee: 
\v 11 According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee, and
according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do: thou
shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee, \add to
\add* the right hand, nor \add to\add* the left. 
\v 12 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the
priest that standeth to minister there before the LORD thy God, or unto the
judge, even that man shall die: and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.
\v 13 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.
\p
\v 14 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, and
shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt say, I will set a king
over me, like as all the nations that \add are\add* about me; 
\v 15 Thou shalt in any wise set \add him\add* king over thee, whom the LORD
thy God shall choose: \add one\add* from among thy brethren shalt thou set
king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee, which \add is
\add* not thy brother. 
\v 16 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to
return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: forasmuch as the
LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall henceforth return no more that way. 
\v 17 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not
away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold. 
\v 18 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he
shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of \add that which is
\add* before the priests the Levites: 
\v 19 And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his
life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of
this law and these statutes, to do them: 
\v 20 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that he turn not
aside from the commandment, \add to\add* the right hand, or \add to
\add* the left: to the end that he may prolong \add his\add* days in his
kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 The priests the Levites, \add and\add* all the tribe of Levi, shall have
no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD
made by fire, and his inheritance. 
\v 2 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD 
\add is\add* their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.
\p
\v 3 And this shall be the priest’s due from the people, from them that offer
a sacrifice, whether \add it be\add* ox or sheep; and they shall give unto the
priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw. 
\v 4 The firstfruit \add also\add* of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil,
and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him. 
\v 5 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to
minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.
\p
\v 6 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he
sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the
LORD shall choose; 
\v 7 Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his
brethren the Levites \add do,\add* which stand there before the LORD. 
\v 8 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the
sale of his patrimony.
\p
\v 9 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou
shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. 
\v 10 There shall not be found among you \add any one\add* that maketh his son
or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, 
\add or\add* an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, 
\v 11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a
necromancer. 
\v 12 For all that do these things \add are\add* an abomination unto the LORD:
and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from
before thee. 
\v 13 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God. 
\v 14 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of
times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered
thee so \add to do.\add*
\p
\v 15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of
thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken; 
\v 16 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the
day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my
God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not. 
\v 17 And the LORD said unto me, They have well \add spoken that\add* which
they have spoken. 
\v 18 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto
thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all
that I shall command him. 
\v 19 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* whosoever will not hearken
unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require \add it
\add* of him. 
\v 20 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I
have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other
gods, even that prophet shall die. 
\v 21 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the
LORD hath not spoken? 
\v 22 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow
not, nor come to pass, that \add is\add* the thing which the LORD hath not
spoken, \add but\add* the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt
not be afraid of him.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the LORD thy
God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and dwellest in their cities, and
in their houses; 
\v 2 Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which
the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it. 
\v 3 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy land, which
the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer
may flee thither.
\p
\v 4 And this \add is\add* the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,
that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom he hated not in
time past; 
\v 5 As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood, and his
hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head
slippeth from the helve, and lighteth upon his neighbour, that he die; he
shall flee unto one of those cities, and live: 
\v 6 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot,
and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him; whereas he 
\add was\add* not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
\v 7 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for
thee. 
\v 8 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn unto thy
fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy
fathers; 
\v 9 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command
thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk ever in his ways; then
shalt thou add three cities more for thee, beside these three: 
\v 10 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD thy God
giveth thee \add for\add* an inheritance, and \add so\add* blood be upon
thee.
\p
\v 11 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him, and rise up
against him, and smite him mortally that he die, and fleeth into one of these
cities: 
\v 12 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence, and deliver
him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he may die. 
\v 13 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away \add the guilt of
\add* innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with thee.
\p
\v 14 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour’s landmark, which they of old time
have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt inherit in the land that the
LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.
\p
\v 15 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any
sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the
mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
\p
\v 16 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him 
\add that which is\add* wrong; 
\v 17 Then both the men, between whom the controversy \add is,\add* shall
stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges, which shall be in
those days; 
\v 18 And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, \add if
\add* the witness \add be\add* a false witness, \add and\add* hath testified
falsely against his brother; 
\v 19 Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto his
brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you. 
\v 20 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth commit
no more any such evil among you. 
\v 21 And thine eye shall not pity; \add but\add* life \add shall go
\add* for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest horses,
and chariots, \add and\add* a people more than thou, be not afraid of them:
for the LORD thy God \add is\add* with thee, which brought thee up out of the
land of Egypt. 
\v 2 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that the priest
shall approach and speak unto the people, 
\v 3 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle
against your enemies: let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble,
neither be ye terrified because of them; 
\v 4 For the LORD your God \add is\add* he that goeth with you, to fight for
you against your enemies, to save you.
\p
\v 5 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man 
\add is there\add* that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let
him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man
dedicate it. 
\v 6 And what man \add is he\add* that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not 
\add yet\add* eaten of it? let him \add also\add* go and return unto his
house, lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it. 
\v 7 And what man \add is there\add* that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not
taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle,
and another man take her. 
\v 8 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say,
What man \add is there that is\add* fearful and fainthearted? let him go and
return unto his house, lest his brethren’s heart faint as well as his heart. 
\v 9 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the
people, that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people.
\p
\v 10 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim
peace unto it. 
\v 11 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open unto thee,
then it shall be, \add that\add* all the people \add that is\add* found
therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee. 
\v 12 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war against thee,
then thou shalt besiege it: 
\v 13 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt
smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: 
\v 14 But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in
the city, \add even\add* all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself;
and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies, which the LORD thy God hath
given thee. 
\v 15 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities \add which are\add* very far off
from thee, which \add are\add* not of the cities of these nations. 
\v 16 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth give thee
\add for\add* an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth: 
\v 17 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; \add namely,\add* the Hittites, and
the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the
Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee: 
\v 18 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations, which they
have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against the LORD your God.
\p
\v 19 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to
take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against
them: for thou mayest eat of them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the
tree of the field \add is\add* man’s \add life\add*) to employ \add them
\add* in the siege: 
\v 20 Only the trees which thou knowest that they \add be\add* not trees for
meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks
against the city that maketh war with thee, until it be subdued.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 If \add one\add* be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee to possess it, lying in the field, \add and\add* it be not known who hath
slain him: 
\v 2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure
unto the cities which \add are\add* round about him that is slain: 
\v 3 And it shall be, \add that\add* the city \add which is\add* next unto the
slain man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not
been wrought with, \add and\add* which hath not drawn in the yoke; 
\v 4 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough
valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer’s
neck there in the valley: 
\v 5 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD thy
God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the LORD;
and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be \add tried: 
\add*
\v 6 And all the elders of that city, \add that are\add* next unto the slain 
\add man,\add* shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the
valley: 
\v 7 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood,
neither have our eyes seen \add it. \add*
\v 8 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and
lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel’s charge. And the blood shall
be forgiven them. 
\v 9 So shalt thou put away the \add guilt of\add* innocent blood from among
you, when thou shalt do \add that which is\add* right in the sight of the
LORD.
\p
\v 10 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God
hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken them captive, 
\v 11 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a desire unto
her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife; 
\v 12 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall shave her
head, and pare her nails; 
\v 13 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall
remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and
after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy
wife. 
\v 14 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her
go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt
not make merchandise of her, because thou hast humbled her.
\p
\v 15 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and they have
born him children, \add both\add* the beloved and the hated; and if the
firstborn son be hers that was hated: 
\v 16 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit \add that
\add* which he hath, \add that\add* he may not make the son of the beloved
firstborn before the son of the hated, \add which is indeed\add* the
firstborn: 
\v 17 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated \add for\add* the
firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he 
\add is\add* the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn 
\add is\add* his.
\p
\v 18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the
voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and \add that,\add* when they
have chastened him, will not hearken unto them: 
\v 19 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out
unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 
\v 20 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son \add is
\add* stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; \add he is
\add* a glutton, and a drunkard. 
\v 21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die: so
shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
\p
\v 22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put
to death, and thou hang him on a tree: 
\v 23 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt in any
wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged \add is\add* accursed of God;)
that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth thee \add for
\add* an inheritance.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Thou shalt not see the brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide
thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother. 
\v 2 And if thy brother \add be\add* not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him
not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee
until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again. 
\v 3 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do with his
raiment; and with all lost things of thy brother’s, which he hath lost, and
thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.
\p
\v 4 Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fall down by the way, and
hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift \add them
\add* up again.
\p
\v 5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall
a man put on a woman’s garment: for all that do so \add are\add* abomination
unto the LORD thy God.
\p
\v 6 If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree, or on
the ground, \add whether they be\add* young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting
upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young:
\v 7 \add But\add* thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young
to thee; that it may be well with thee, and \add that\add* thou mayest prolong
\add thy\add* days.
\p
\v 8 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a battlement for thy
roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if any man fall from
thence.
\p
\v 9 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of thy
seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, be defiled.
\p
\v 10 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.
\p
\v 11 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, \add as\add* of woollen
and linen together.
\p
\v 12 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture,
wherewith thou coverest \add thyself.\add*
\p
\v 13 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her, 
\v 14 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name upon
her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a
maid: 
\v 15 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring
forth \add the tokens of\add* the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the
city in the gate: 
\v 16 And the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter
unto this man to wife, and he hateth her; 
\v 17 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech \add against her,\add*
saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these \add are the tokens of
\add* my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the
elders of the city. 
\v 18 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him; 
\v 19 And they shall amerce him in an hundred \add shekels\add* of silver, and
give \add them\add* unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up
an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not
put her away all his days. 
\v 20 But if this thing be true, \add and the tokens of\add* virginity be not
found for the damsel: 
\v 21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house,
and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she
hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father’s house: so
shalt thou put evil away from among you.
\p
\v 22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they
shall both of them die, \add both\add* the man that lay with the woman, and
the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.
\p
\v 23 If a damsel \add that is\add* a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and
a man find her in the city, and lie with her; 
\v 24 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye
shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not,
\add being\add* in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his
neighbour’s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.
\p
\v 25 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force
her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die: 
\v 26 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; \add there is\add* in the
damsel no sin \add worthy\add* of death: for as when a man riseth against his
neighbour, and slayeth him, even so \add is\add* this matter: 
\v 27 For he found her in the field, \add and\add* the betrothed damsel cried,
and \add there was\add* none to save her.
\p
\v 28 If a man find a damsel \add that is\add* a virgin, which is not
betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; 
\v 29 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father fifty
\add shekels\add* of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath
humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.
\p
\v 30 A man shall not take his father’s wife, nor discover his father’s
skirt.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut off, shall
not enter into the congregation of the LORD. 
\v 2 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to his
tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the LORD. 
\v 3 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD;
even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of
the LORD for ever: 
\v 4 Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way, when ye
came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of
Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee. 
\v 5 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam; but the LORD
thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto thee, because the LORD thy God
loved thee. 
\v 6 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for
ever.
\p
\v 7 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he \add is\add* thy brother: thou
shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in his land. 
\v 8 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation
of the LORD in their third generation.
\p
\v 9 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep thee from
every wicked thing.
\p
\v 10 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go abroad out of the
camp, he shall not come within the camp: 
\v 11 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash \add himself
\add* with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp 
\add again.\add*
\p
\v 12 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou shalt go
forth abroad: 
\v 13 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be, when thou
wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith, and shalt turn back and
cover that which cometh from thee: 
\v 14 For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee,
and to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be holy:
that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.
\p
\v 15 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from
his master unto thee: 
\v 16 He shall dwell with thee, \add even\add* among you, in that place which
he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best: thou shalt not
oppress him.
\p
\v 17 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of
the sons of Israel. 
\v 18 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, into
the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even both these \add are
\add* abomination unto the LORD thy God.
\p
\v 19 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money, usury of
victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury: 
\v 20 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou
shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all that
thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it.
\p
\v 21 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt not slack to
pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be
sin in thee. 
\v 22 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee. 
\v 23 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform; 
\add even\add* a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD
thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.
\p
\v 24 When thou comest into thy neighbour’s vineyard, then thou mayest eat
grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put \add any
\add* in thy vessel. 
\v 25 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then thou
mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto
thy neighbour’s standing corn.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that
she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her:
then let him write her a bill of divorcement, and give \add it\add* in her
hand, and send her out of his house. 
\v 2 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another
man’s \add wife. \add*
\v 3 And \add if\add* the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
divorcement, and giveth \add it\add* in her hand, and sendeth her out of his
house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to \add be\add* his wife;
\v 4 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his
wife, after that she is defiled; for that \add is\add* abomination before the
LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth
thee \add for\add* an inheritance.
\p
\v 5 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither
shall he be charged with any business: \add but\add* he shall be free at home
one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken.
\p
\v 6 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge: for he
taketh \add a man’s\add* life to pledge.
\p
\v 7 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel,
and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and
thou shalt put evil away from among you.
\p
\v 8 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do
according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you: as I commanded
them, so ye shall observe to do. 
\v 9 Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye
were come forth out of Egypt.
\p
\v 10 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his
house to fetch his pledge. 
\v 11 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring
out the pledge abroad unto thee. 
\v 12 And if the man \add be\add* poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:
\v 13 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth
down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee: and it shall be
righteousness unto thee before the LORD thy God.
\p
\v 14 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant \add that is\add* poor and
needy, \add whether he be\add* of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that 
\add are\add* in thy land within thy gates: 
\v 15 At his day thou shalt give \add him\add* his hire, neither shall the sun
go down upon it; for he \add is\add* poor, and setteth his heart upon it: lest
he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto thee. 
\v 16 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall
the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death
for his own sin.
\p
\v 17 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, \add nor
\add* of the fatherless; nor take a widow’s raiment to pledge: 
\v 18 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD
thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command thee to do this thing.
\p
\v 19 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a
sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it: it shall be for the
stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow: that the LORD thy God may
bless thee in all the work of thine hands. 
\v 20 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs
again: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow. 
\v 21 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean 
\add it\add* afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and
for the widow. 
\v 22 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt:
therefore I command thee to do this thing.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto judgment, that
\add the judges\add* may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous,
and condemn the wicked. 
\v 2 And it shall be, if the wicked man \add be\add* worthy to be beaten, that
the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten before his face,
according to his fault, by a certain number. 
\v 3 Forty stripes he may give him, \add and\add* not exceed: lest, 
\add if\add* he should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.
\p
\v 4 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out \add the corn.
\add*
\p
\v 5 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the
wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband’s
brother shall go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the
duty of an husband’s brother unto her. 
\v 6 And it shall be, \add that\add* the firstborn which she beareth shall
succeed in the name of his brother \add which is\add* dead, that his name be
not put out of Israel. 
\v 7 And if the man like not to take his brother’s wife, then let his
brother’s wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say, My husband’s
brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not
perform the duty of my husband’s brother. 
\v 8 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him: and 
\add if\add* he stand \add to it,\add* and say, I like not to take her; 
\v 9 Then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the presence of the
elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall
answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his
brother’s house. 
\v 10 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that hath his
shoe loosed.
\p
\v 11 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the one
draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth
him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh him by the secrets: 
\v 12 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity \add her.
\add*
\p
\v 13 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small. 
\v 14 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a
small. 
\v 15 \add But\add* thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and
just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened in the land
which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 
\v 16 For all that do such things, \add and\add* all that do unrighteously, 
\add are\add* an abomination unto the LORD thy God.
\p
\v 17 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were come forth
out of Egypt; 
\v 18 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee, \add even
\add* all \add that were\add* feeble behind thee, when thou \add wast
\add* faint and weary; and he feared not God. 
\v 19 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee rest from
all thine enemies round about, in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee
\add for\add* an inheritance to possess it, \add that\add* thou shalt blot out
the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven; thou shalt not forget \add it.
\add*
\c 26
\p
\v 1 And it shall be, when thou \add art\add* come in unto the land which the
LORD thy God giveth thee \add for\add* an inheritance, and possessest it, and
dwellest therein; 
\v 2 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which
thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy God giveth thee, and shalt put
\add it\add* in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God
shall choose to place his name there. 
\v 3 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say
unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God, that I am come unto the
country which the LORD sware unto our fathers for to give us. 
\v 4 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down
before the altar of the LORD thy God. 
\v 5 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian ready to
perish \add was\add* my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned
there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous: 
\v 6 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us
hard bondage: 
\v 7 And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD heard our
voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour, and our oppression: 
\v 8 And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with
an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with
wonders: 
\v 9 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, 
\add even\add* a land that floweth with milk and honey. 
\v 10 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land, which thou,
O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it before the LORD thy God, and
worship before the LORD thy God: 
\v 11 And thou shalt rejoice in every good \add thing\add* which the LORD thy
God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the
stranger that \add is\add* among you.
\p
\v 12 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase
the third year, \add which is\add* the year of tithing, and hast given 
\add it\add* unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow,
that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled; 
\v 13 Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought away the
hallowed things out of \add mine\add* house, and also have given them unto the
Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according
to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed
thy commandments, neither have I forgotten \add them: \add*
\v 14 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken away 
\add ought\add* thereof for \add any\add* unclean \add use,\add* nor given 
\add ought\add* thereof for the dead: \add but\add* I have hearkened to the
voice of the LORD my God, \add and\add* have done according to all that thou
hast commanded me. 
\v 15 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people
Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our
fathers, a land that floweth with milk and honey.
\p
\v 16 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these statutes and
judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart, and
with all thy soul. 
\v 17 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to walk in his
ways, and to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and
to hearken unto his voice: 
\v 18 And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people, as
he hath promised thee, and that \add thou\add* shouldest keep all his
commandments; 
\v 19 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in praise,
and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the
LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep
all the commandments which I command you this day. 
\v 2 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto the land
which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt set thee up great stones,
and plaister them with plaister: 
\v 3 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when thou art
passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land which the LORD thy God
giveth thee, a land that floweth with milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy
fathers hath promised thee. 
\v 4 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, \add that\add* ye
shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and
thou shalt plaister them with plaister. 
\v 5 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an altar of
stones: thou shalt not lift up \add any\add* iron \add tool\add* upon them. 
\v 6 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole stones: and thou
shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD thy God: 
\v 7 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice
before the LORD thy God. 
\v 8 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very
plainly.
\p
\v 9 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel, saying, Take
heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art become the people of the LORD
thy God. 
\v 10 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and do his
commandments and his statutes, which I command thee this day.
\p
\v 11 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying, 
\v 12 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when ye are
come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and
Benjamin: 
\v 13 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher,
and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
\p
\v 14 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of Israel with a
loud voice, 
\v 15 Cursed \add be\add* the man that maketh \add any\add* graven or molten
image, an abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman,
and putteth \add it\add* in \add a\add* secret \add place.\add* And all the
people shall answer and say, Amen. 
\v 16 Cursed \add be\add* he that setteth light by his father or his mother.
And all the people shall say, Amen. 
\v 17 Cursed \add be\add* he that removeth his neighbour’s landmark. And all
the people shall say, Amen. 
\v 18 Cursed \add be\add* he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way.
And all the people shall say, Amen. 
\v 19 Cursed \add be\add* he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
\v 20 Cursed \add be\add* he that lieth with his father’s wife; because he
uncovereth his father’s skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
\v 21 Cursed \add be\add* he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the
people shall say, Amen. 
\v 22 Cursed \add be\add* he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his
father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. 
\v 23 Cursed \add be\add* he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the
people shall say, Amen. 
\v 24 Cursed \add be\add* he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the
people shall say, Amen. 
\v 25 Cursed \add be\add* he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person.
And all the people shall say, Amen. 
\v 26 Cursed \add be\add* he that confirmeth not \add all\add* the words of
this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the
voice of the LORD thy God, to observe \add and\add* to do all his commandments
which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on high
above all nations of the earth: 
\v 2 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee, if thou
shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God. 
\v 3 Blessed \add shalt\add* thou \add be\add* in the city, and blessed 
\add shalt\add* thou \add be\add* in the field. 
\v 4 Blessed \add shall be\add* the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks
of thy sheep. 
\v 5 Blessed \add shall be\add* thy basket and thy store. 
\v 6 Blessed \add shalt\add* thou \add be\add* when thou comest in, and
blessed \add shalt\add* thou \add be\add* when thou goest out. 
\v 7 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be
smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and flee
before thee seven ways. 
\v 8 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses, and in
all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall bless thee in the land
which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 
\v 9 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he hath
sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy God, and
walk in his ways. 
\v 10 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name
of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee. 
\v 11 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit of thy
body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, in the
land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give thee. 
\v 12 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to give the
rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and
thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow. 
\v 13 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt
be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou hearken unto the
commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee this day, to observe
and to do \add them: \add*
\v 14 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee
this day, to the right hand, or \add to\add* the left, to go after other gods
to serve them.
\p
\v 15 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of
the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which
I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come upon thee, and
overtake thee: 
\v 16 Cursed \add shalt\add* thou \add be\add* in the city, and cursed 
\add shalt\add* thou \add be\add* in the field. 
\v 17 Cursed \add shall be\add* thy basket and thy store. 
\v 18 Cursed \add shall be\add* the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep. 
\v 19 Cursed \add shalt\add* thou \add be\add* when thou comest in, and cursed
\add shalt\add* thou \add be\add* when thou goest out. 
\v 20 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in all that
thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be destroyed, and until
thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou
hast forsaken me. 
\v 21 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he have
consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess it. 
\v 22 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever, and with
an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the sword, and with
blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee until thou perish. 
\v 23 And thy heaven that \add is\add* over thy head shall be brass, and the
earth that is under thee \add shall be\add* iron. 
\v 24 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from heaven
shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed. 
\v 25 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies: thou shalt
go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them: and shalt be
removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. 
\v 26 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and unto the
beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray \add them\add* away. 
\v 27 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the emerods,
and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be healed. 
\v 28 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment
of heart: 
\v 29 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and
thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only oppressed and
spoiled evermore, and no man shall save \add thee. \add*
\v 30 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her: thou
shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt plant a
vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof. 
\v 31 Thine ox \add shall be\add* slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not
eat thereof: thine ass \add shall be\add* violently taken away from before thy
face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep \add shall be\add* given
unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue \add them. \add*
\v 32 Thy sons and thy daughters \add shall be\add* given unto another people,
and thine eyes shall look, and fail \add with longing\add* for them all the
day long: and \add there shall be\add* no might in thine hand. 
\v 33 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation which thou
knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway: 
\v 34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt
see. 
\v 35 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a sore
botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy
head. 
\v 36 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set over thee,
unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known; and there shalt
thou serve other gods, wood and stone. 
\v 37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword, among
all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee. 
\v 38 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather 
\add but\add* little in; for the locust shall consume it. 
\v 39 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress \add them,\add* but shalt neither
drink \add of\add* the wine, nor gather \add the grapes;\add* for the worms
shall eat them. 
\v 40 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt
not anoint \add thyself\add* with the oil; for thine olive shall cast 
\add his fruit. \add*
\v 41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for
they shall go into captivity. 
\v 42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume. 
\v 43 The stranger that \add is\add* within thee shall get up above thee very
high; and thou shalt come down very low. 
\v 44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the
head, and thou shalt be the tail. 
\v 45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee,
and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou hearkenedst not unto
the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which
he commanded thee: 
\v 46 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and upon thy
seed for ever. 
\v 47 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and with
gladness of heart, for the abundance of all \add things; \add*
\v 48 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall send
against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in want of all 
\add things:\add* and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until he have
destroyed thee. 
\v 49 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the end of the
earth, \add as swift\add* as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue thou
shalt not understand; 
\v 50 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the
old, nor shew favour to the young: 
\v 51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy land,
until thou be destroyed: which \add also\add* shall not leave thee \add either
\add* corn, wine, or oil, \add or\add* the increase of thy kine, or flocks of
thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee. 
\v 52 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and fenced
walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land: and he shall
besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God
hath given thee. 
\v 53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons
and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee, in the siege,
and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee: 
\v 54 \add So that\add* the man \add that is\add* tender among you, and very
delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his
bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave: 
\v 55 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children
whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the siege, and in the
straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates. 
\v 56 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not adventure to
set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her
eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and
toward her daughter, 
\v 57 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet, and
toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for want of
all \add things\add* secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine
enemy shall distress thee in thy gates. 
\v 58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are
written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name,
THE LORD THY GOD; 
\v 59 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues of thy
seed, \add even\add* great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore
sicknesses, and of long continuance. 
\v 60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou
wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee. 
\v 61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which \add is\add* not written in
the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be
destroyed. 
\v 62 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of
heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the LORD thy
God. 
\v 63 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* as the LORD rejoiced over you
to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you to
destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from off the
land whither thou goest to possess it. 
\v 64 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one end of
the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other gods, which
neither thou nor thy fathers have known, \add even\add* wood and stone. 
\v 65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall the sole
of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a trembling heart,
and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind: 
\v 66 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day
and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life: 
\v 67 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at even thou
shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine heart wherewith
thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 
\v 68 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by the way
whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and there ye shall
be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy 
\add you.\add*
\c 29
\p
\v 1 These \add are\add* the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the
covenant which he made with them in Horeb.
\p
\v 2 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have seen all
that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto
all his servants, and unto all his land; 
\v 3 The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those
great miracles: 
\v 4 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see,
and ears to hear, unto this day. 
\v 5 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes are not
waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot. 
\v 6 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink: that
ye might know that I \add am\add* the LORD your God. 
\v 7 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the
king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them: 
\v 8 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto the
Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. 
\v 9 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that ye may
prosper in all that ye do.
\p
\v 10 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your captains of
your tribes, your elders, and your officers, \add with\add* all the men of
Israel, 
\v 11 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that \add is\add* in thy
camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water: 
\v 12 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God, and into
his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee this day: 
\v 13 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself, and 
\add that\add* he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee, and as he
hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. 
\v 14 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath; 
\v 15 But with \add him\add* that standeth here with us this day before the
LORD our God, and also with \add him\add* that \add is\add* not here with us
this day: 
\v 16 (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we came
through the nations which ye passed by; 
\v 17 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone,
silver and gold, which \add were\add* among them:) 
\v 18 Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose
heart turneth away this day from the LORD our God, to go \add and\add* serve
the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that beareth
gall and wormwood; 
\v 19 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse, that he
bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the
imagination of mine heart, to add drunkenness to thirst: 
\v 20 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD and his
jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in
this book shall lie upon him, and the LORD shall blot out his name from under
heaven. 
\v 21 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of
Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this
book of the law: 
\v 22 So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after
you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land, shall say, when they
see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon
it; 
\v 23 \add And that\add* the whole land thereof \add is\add* brimstone, and
salt, \add and\add* burning, \add that\add* it is not sown, nor beareth, nor
any grass groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah, Admah,
and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath: 
\v 24 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus unto this
land? what \add meaneth\add* the heat of this great anger? 
\v 25 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD
God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out
of the land of Egypt: 
\v 26 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they
knew not, and \add whom\add* he had not given unto them: 
\v 27 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon
it all the curses that are written in this book: 
\v 28 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and
in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as \add it is
\add* this day. 
\v 29 The secret \add things belong\add* unto the LORD our God: but 
\add those things which\add* are revealed \add belong\add* unto us and to our
children for ever, that \add we\add* may do all the words of this law.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the
blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call 
\add them\add* to mind among all the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath
driven thee, 
\v 2 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his voice
according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all
thine heart, and with all thy soul; 
\v 3 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion
upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the
LORD thy God hath scattered thee. 
\v 4 If \add any\add* of thine be driven out unto the outmost \add parts
\add* of heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and from
thence will he fetch thee: 
\v 5 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers
possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply
thee above thy fathers. 
\v 6 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy
seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul,
that thou mayest live. 
\v 7 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on
them that hate thee, which persecuted thee. 
\v 8 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all his
commandments which I command thee this day. 
\v 9 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of thine
hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the
fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD will again rejoice over thee for
good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 
\v 10 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his
commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law, 
\add and\add* if thou turn unto the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and
with all thy soul.
\p
\v 11 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it \add is
\add* not hidden from thee, neither \add is\add* it far off. 
\v 12 It \add is\add* not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it? 
\v 13 Neither \add is\add* it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and
do it? 
\v 14 But the word \add is\add* very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
heart, that thou mayest do it.
\p
\v 15 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
\v 16 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to walk in his
ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that
thou mayest live and multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the
land whither thou goest to possess it. 
\v 17 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be
drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them; 
\v 18 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, \add and
that\add* ye shall not prolong \add your\add* days upon the land, whither thou
passest over Jordan to go to possess it. 
\v 19 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, \add that
\add* I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore
choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live: 
\v 20 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, \add and\add* that thou mayest
obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he \add is
\add* thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest dwell in the land
which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to
give them.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel. 
\v 2 And he said unto them, I \add am\add* an hundred and twenty years old
this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath said unto me,
Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
\v 3 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, \add and\add* he will
destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: 
\add and\add* Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD hath said. 
\v 4 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of
the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed. 
\v 5 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may do unto
them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded you. 
\v 6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the
LORD thy God, he \add it is\add* that doth go with thee; he will not fail
thee, nor forsake thee.
\p
\v 7 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all
Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must go with this people
unto the land which the LORD hath sworn unto their fathers to give them; and
thou shalt cause them to inherit it. 
\v 8 And the LORD, he \add it is\add* that doth go before thee; he will be
with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be
dismayed.
\p
\v 9 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests the sons of
Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and unto all the elders
of Israel. 
\v 10 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of \add every\add* seven
years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, 
\v 11 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in the place
which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law before all Israel in their
hearing. 
\v 12 Gather the people together, men, and women, and children, and thy
stranger that \add is\add* within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they
may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this
law: 
\v 13 And \add that\add* their children, which have not known \add any thing,
\add* may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live in the
land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.
\p
\v 14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou must
die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the
congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and
presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 15 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the
pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.
\p
\v 16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers;
and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers
of the land, whither they go \add to be\add* among them, and will forsake me,
and break my covenant which I have made with them. 
\v 17 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will
forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured,
and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that
day. Are not these evils come upon us, because our God \add is\add* not among
us? 
\v 18 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they
shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods. 
\v 19 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children of
Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against
the children of Israel. 
\v 20 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto
their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and
filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto other gods, and
serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant. 
\v 21 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen
them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not
be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination
which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which
I sware.
\p
\v 22 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children
of Israel. 
\v 23 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a
good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which
I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.
\p
\v 24 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of
this law in a book, until they were finished, 
\v 25 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of
the LORD, saying, 
\v 26 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the
covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against
thee. 
\v 27 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am yet
alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the LORD; and how
much more after my death?
\p
\v 28 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I
may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record
against them. 
\v 29 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt \add yourselves,
\add* and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will
befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of the
LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands. 
\v 30 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words
of this song, until they were ended.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of
my mouth. 
\v 2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as
the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass: 
\v 3 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto
our God. 
\v 4 \add He is\add* the Rock, his work \add is\add* perfect: for all his ways
\add are\add* judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right 
\add is\add* he. 
\v 5 They have corrupted themselves, their spot \add is\add* not \add the
spot\add* of his children: \add they are\add* a perverse and crooked
generation. 
\v 6 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? \add is
\add* not he thy father \add that\add* hath bought thee? hath he not made
thee, and established thee?
\p
\v 7 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy
father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee. 
\v 8 When the most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he
separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the
number of the children of Israel. 
\v 9 For the LORD’S portion \add is\add* his people; Jacob \add is\add* the
lot of his inheritance. 
\v 10 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he
led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. 
\v 11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth
abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: 
\v 12 \add So\add* the LORD alone did lead him, and \add there was\add* no
strange god with him. 
\v 13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the
increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil
out of the flinty rock; 
\v 14 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the
breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst
drink the pure blood of the grape.
\p
\v 15 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown
thick, thou art covered \add with fatness;\add* then he forsook God 
\add which\add* made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. 
\v 16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange \add gods,\add* with
abominations provoked they him to anger. 
\v 17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to
new \add gods that\add* came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. 
\v 18 Of the Rock \add that\add* begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
forgotten God that formed thee. 
\v 19 And when the LORD saw \add it,\add* he abhorred \add them,\add* because
of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. 
\v 20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end 
\add shall be:\add* for they \add are\add* a very froward generation, children
in whom \add is\add* no faith. 
\v 21 They have moved me to jealousy with \add that which is\add* not God;
they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to
jealousy with \add those which are\add* not a people; I will provoke them to
anger with a foolish nation. 
\v 22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest
hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the
foundations of the mountains. 
\v 23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them. 
\v 24 \add They shall be\add* burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning
heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon
them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. 
\v 25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man
and the virgin, the suckling \add also\add* with the man of gray hairs. 
\v 26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance
of them to cease from among men: 
\v 27 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries
should behave themselves strangely, \add and\add* lest they should say, Our
hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this. 
\v 28 For they \add are\add* a nation void of counsel, neither \add is there
any\add* understanding in them. 
\v 29 O that they were wise, \add that\add* they understood this, \add that
\add* they would consider their latter end! 
\v 30 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,
except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up? 
\v 31 For their rock \add is\add* not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
\add being\add* judges. 
\v 32 For their vine \add is\add* of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
Gomorrah: their grapes \add are\add* grapes of gall, their clusters 
\add are\add* bitter: 
\v 33 Their wine \add is\add* the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
asps. 
\v 34 \add Is\add* not this laid up in store with me, \add and\add* sealed up
among my treasures? 
\v 35 To me \add belongeth\add* vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall
slide in \add due\add* time: for the day of their calamity \add is\add* at
hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. 
\v 36 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his
servants, when he seeth that \add their\add* power is gone, and \add there is
\add* none shut up, or left. 
\v 37 And he shall say, Where \add are\add* their gods, \add their\add* rock
in whom they trusted, 
\v 38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, \add and\add* drank the wine
of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, \add and\add* be your
protection. 
\v 39 See now that I, \add even\add* I, \add am\add* he, and \add there is
\add* no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither 
\add is there any\add* that can deliver out of my hand. 
\v 40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. 
\v 41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I
will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. 
\v 42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour
flesh; \add and that\add* with the blood of the slain and of the captives,
from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. 
\v 43 Rejoice, O ye nations, \add with\add* his people: for he will avenge the
blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will
be merciful unto his land, \add and\add* to his people.
\p
\v 44 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the
people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. 
\v 45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel: 
\v 46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I
testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to
do, all the words of this law. 
\v 47 For it \add is\add* not a vain thing for you; because it \add is
\add* your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong \add your\add* days
in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it. 
\v 48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying, 
\v 49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, \add unto\add* mount Nebo, which
\add is\add* in the land of Moab, that \add is\add* over against Jericho; and
behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a
possession: 
\v 50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy
people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his
people: 
\v 51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the
waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me
not in the midst of the children of Israel. 
\v 52 Yet thou shalt see the land before \add thee;\add* but thou shalt not go
thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 And this \add is\add* the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God
blessed the children of Israel before his death. 
\v 2 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them;
he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints:
from his right hand \add went\add* a fiery law for them. 
\v 3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints \add are\add* in thy hand: and
they sat down at thy feet; \add every one\add* shall receive of thy words. 
\v 4 Moses commanded us a law, \add even\add* the inheritance of the
congregation of Jacob. 
\v 5 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people \add and
\add* the tribes of Israel were gathered together.
\p
\v 6 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let \add not\add* his men be few.
\p
\v 7 And this \add is the blessing\add* of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the
voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for
him; and be thou an help \add to him\add* from his enemies. 
\v 8 And of Levi he said, \add Let\add* thy Thummim and thy Urim \add be
\add* with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, \add and with
\add* whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; 
\v 9 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither
did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have
observed thy word, and kept thy covenant. 
\v 10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put
incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar. 
\v 11 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite
through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him,
that they rise not again.
\p
\v 12 \add And\add* of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell
in safety by him; \add and the LORD\add* shall cover him all the day long, and
he shall dwell between his shoulders.
\p
\v 13 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD \add be\add* his land, for
the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth
beneath, 
\v 14 And for the precious fruits \add brought forth\add* by the sun, and for
the precious things put forth by the moon, 
\v 15 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious
things of the lasting hills, 
\v 16 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and 
\add for\add* the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let \add the
blessing\add* come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of
him \add that was\add* separated from his brethren. 
\v 17 His glory \add is like\add* the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
\add are like\add* the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people
together to the ends of the earth: and they \add are\add* the ten thousands of
Ephraim, and they \add are\add* the thousands of Manasseh.
\p
\v 18 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and,
Issachar, in thy tents. 
\v 19 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer
sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck \add of\add* the abundance of
the seas, and \add of\add* treasures hid in the sand.
\p
\v 20 And of Gad he said, Blessed \add be\add* he that enlargeth Gad: he
dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head. 
\v 21 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, \add in
\add* a portion of the lawgiver, \add was he\add* seated; and he came with the
heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments
with Israel.
\p
\v 22 And of Dan he said, Dan \add is\add* a lion’s whelp: he shall leap from
Bashan.
\p
\v 23 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour, and full
with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west and the south.
\p
\v 24 And of Asher he said, \add Let\add* Asher \add be\add* blessed with
children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in
oil. 
\v 25 Thy shoes \add shall be\add* iron and brass; and as thy days, 
\add so shall\add* thy strength \add be.\add*
\p
\v 26 \add There is\add* none like unto the God of Jeshurun, \add who
\add* rideth upon the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky. 
\v 27 The eternal God \add is thy\add* refuge, and underneath \add are
\add* the everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from before
thee; and shall say, Destroy \add them. \add*
\v 28 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob 
\add shall be\add* upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop
down dew. 
\v 29 Happy \add art\add* thou, O Israel: who \add is\add* like unto thee, O
people saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who \add is\add* the
sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and
thou shalt tread upon their high places.
\c 34
\p
\v 1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to
the top of Pisgah, that \add is\add* over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed
him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, 
\v 2 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land
of Judah, unto the utmost sea, 
\v 3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm
trees, unto Zoar. 
\v 4 And the LORD said unto him, This \add is\add* the land which I sware unto
Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I
have caused thee to see \add it\add* with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go
over thither.
\p
\v 5 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab,
according to the word of the LORD. 
\v 6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against
Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.
\p
\v 7 And Moses \add was\add* an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his
eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
\p
\v 8 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty
days: so the days of weeping \add and\add* mourning for Moses were ended.
\p
\v 9 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had
laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and
did as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 10 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the
LORD knew face to face, 
\v 11 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the
land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land, 
\v 12 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses
shewed in the sight of all Israel.
