\mt Ecclesiastes or, the Preacher 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. 
\v 2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all 
\add is\add* vanity. 
\v 3 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun? 
\v 4 \add One\add* generation passeth away, and \add another\add* generation
cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. 
\v 5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place
where he arose. 
\v 6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it
whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his
circuits. 
\v 7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea \add is\add* not full; unto
the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. 
\v 8 All things \add are\add* full of labour; man cannot utter \add it:
\add* the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. 
\v 9 The thing that hath been, it \add is that\add* which shall be; and that
which is done \add is\add* that which shall be done: and \add there is
\add* no new \add thing\add* under the sun. 
\v 10 Is there \add any\add* thing whereof it may be said, See, this 
\add is\add* new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. 
\v 11 \add There is\add* no remembrance of former \add things;\add* neither
shall there be \add any\add* remembrance of \add things\add* that are to come
with \add those\add* that shall come after.
\p
\v 12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
\v 13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all 
\add things\add* that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given
to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. 
\v 14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all
\add is\add* vanity and vexation of spirit. 
\v 15 \add That which is\add* crooked cannot be made straight: and that which
is wanting cannot be numbered. 
\v 16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate,
and have gotten more wisdom than all \add they\add* that have been before me
in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. 
\v 17 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I
perceived that this also is vexation of spirit. 
\v 18 For in much wisdom \add is\add* much grief: and he that increaseth
knowledge increaseth sorrow.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore
enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also \add is\add* vanity. 
\v 2 I said of laughter, \add It is\add* mad: and of mirth, What doeth it? 
\v 3 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting mine
heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what \add was
\add* that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all
the days of their life. 
\v 4 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards: 
\v 5 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all 
\add kind of\add* fruits: 
\v 6 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth
trees: 
\v 7 I got \add me\add* servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that
were in Jerusalem before me: 
\v 8 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings
and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women singers, and the delights
of the sons of men, \add as\add* musical instruments, and that of all sorts. 
\v 9 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in
Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 
\v 10 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my
heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour: and this was my
portion of all my labour. 
\v 11 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the
labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all \add was\add* vanity and
vexation of spirit, and \add there was\add* no profit under the sun. 
\v 12 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what 
\add can\add* the man \add do\add* that cometh after the king? \add even
\add* that which hath been already done. 
\v 13 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth
darkness. 
\v 14 The wise man’s eyes \add are\add* in his head; but the fool walketh in
darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all. 
\v 15 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it happeneth
even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this
also \add is\add* vanity. 
\v 16 For \add there is\add* no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool
for ever; seeing that which now \add is\add* in the days to come shall all be
forgotten. And how dieth the wise \add man?\add* as the fool. 
\v 17 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under the sun
is grievous unto me: for all \add is\add* vanity and vexation of spirit.
\p
\v 18 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun: because I
should leave it unto the man that shall be after me. 
\v 19 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise \add man\add* or a fool? yet
shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured, and wherein I
have shewed myself wise under the sun. This \add is\add* also vanity. 
\v 20 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour
which I took under the sun. 
\v 21 For there is a man whose labour \add is\add* in wisdom, and in
knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he
leave it \add for\add* his portion. This also \add is\add* vanity and a great
evil. 
\v 22 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of his heart,
wherein he hath laboured under the sun? 
\v 23 For all his days \add are\add* sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his
heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.
\p
\v 24 \add There is\add* nothing better for a man, \add than\add* that he
should eat and drink, and \add that\add* he should make his soul enjoy good in
his labour. This also I saw, that it \add was\add* from the hand of God. 
\v 25 For who can eat, or who else can hasten \add hereunto,\add* more than
I? 
\v 26 For \add God\add* giveth to a man that \add is\add* good in his sight
wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather
and to heap up, that he may give to \add him that is\add* good before God.
This also \add is\add* vanity and vexation of spirit.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 To every \add thing there is\add* a season, and a time to every purpose
under the heaven: 
\v 2 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to
pluck up \add that which is\add* planted; 
\v 3 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to
build up; 
\v 4 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to
dance; 
\v 5 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time
to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; 
\v 6 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast
away; 
\v 7 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to
speak; 
\v 8 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace. 
\v 9 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth? 
\v 10 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be
exercised in it. 
\v 11 He hath made every \add thing\add* beautiful in his time: also he hath
set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God
maketh from the beginning to the end. 
\v 12 I know that \add there is\add* no good in them, but for \add a man
\add* to rejoice, and to do good in his life. 
\v 13 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all
his labour, it \add is\add* the gift of God. 
\v 14 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be
put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth \add it,\add* that 
\add men\add* should fear before him. 
\v 15 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been;
and God requireth that which is past.
\p
\v 16 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, \add that
\add* wickedness \add was\add* there; and the place of righteousness, 
\add that\add* iniquity \add was\add* there. 
\v 17 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for
\add there is\add* a time there for every purpose and for every work. 
\v 18 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God
might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.
\v 19 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one
thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all
one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all 
\add is\add* vanity. 
\v 20 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
\v 21 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the
beast that goeth downward to the earth? 
\v 22 Wherefore I perceive that \add there is\add* nothing better, than that a
man should rejoice in his own works; for that \add is\add* his portion: for
who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
\c 4
\p
\v 1 So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the
sun: and behold the tears of \add such as were\add* oppressed, and they had no
comforter; and on the side of their oppressors \add there was\add* power; but
they had no comforter. 
\v 2 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than the living
which are yet alive. 
\v 3 Yea, better \add is he\add* than both they, which hath not yet been, who
hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.
\p
\v 4 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that for this a
man is envied of his neighbour. This \add is\add* also vanity and vexation of
spirit. 
\v 5 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh. 
\v 6 Better \add is\add* an handful \add with\add* quietness, than both the
hands full \add with\add* travail and vexation of spirit.
\p
\v 7 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun. 
\v 8 There is one \add alone,\add* and \add there is\add* not a second; yea,
he hath neither child nor brother: yet \add is there\add* no end of all his
labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither \add saith he,
\add* For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good? This \add is
\add* also vanity, yea, it \add is\add* a sore travail.
\p
\v 9 Two \add are\add* better than one; because they have a good reward for
their labour. 
\v 10 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him 
\add that is\add* alone when he falleth; for \add he hath\add* not another to
help him up. 
\v 11 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm
\add alone? \add*
\v 12 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold
cord is not quickly broken.
\p
\v 13 Better \add is\add* a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish
king, who will no more be admonished. 
\v 14 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also \add he that is
\add* born in his kingdom becometh poor. 
\v 15 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the second
child that shall stand up in his stead. 
\v 16 \add There is\add* no end of all the people, \add even\add* of all that
have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him.
Surely this also \add is\add* vanity and vexation of spirit.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to
hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do
evil. 
\v 2 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter 
\add any\add* thing before God: for God \add is\add* in heaven, and thou upon
earth: therefore let thy words be few. 
\v 3 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool’s voice
\add is known\add* by multitude of words. 
\v 4 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for \add he hath
\add* no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed. 
\v 5 Better \add is it\add* that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
shouldest vow and not pay. 
\v 6 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before
the angel, that it \add was\add* an error: wherefore should God be angry at
thy voice, and destroy the work of thine hands? 
\v 7 For in the multitude of dreams and many words \add there are\add* also 
\add divers\add* vanities: but fear thou God.
\p
\v 8 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of
judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter: for \add he that
is\add* higher than the highest regardeth; and \add there be\add* higher than
they.
\p
\v 9 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king \add himself
\add* is served by the field. 
\v 10 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that
loveth abundance with increase: this \add is\add* also vanity. 
\v 11 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good 
\add is there\add* to the owners thereof, saving the beholding \add of them
\add* with their eyes? 
\v 12 The sleep of a labouring man \add is\add* sweet, whether he eat little
or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. 
\v 13 There is a sore evil \add which\add* I have seen under the sun, 
\add namely,\add* riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt. 
\v 14 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a son, and 
\add there is\add* nothing in his hand. 
\v 15 As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he
came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his
hand. 
\v 16 And this also \add is\add* a sore evil, \add that\add* in all points as
he came, so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the
wind? 
\v 17 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and \add he hath\add* much
sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
\p
\v 18 Behold \add that\add* which I have seen: \add it is\add* good and comely
\add for one\add* to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which God giveth him:
for it \add is\add* his portion. 
\v 19 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given
him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his
labour; this \add is\add* the gift of God. 
\v 20 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God
answereth \add him\add* in the joy of his heart.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it \add is
\add* common among men: 
\v 2 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so that he
wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not
power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it: this \add is\add* vanity, and
it \add is\add* an evil disease.
\p
\v 3 If a man beget an hundred \add children,\add* and live many years, so
that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good, and
also \add that\add* he have no burial; I say, \add that\add* an untimely birth
\add is\add* better than he. 
\v 4 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and his name
shall be covered with darkness. 
\v 5 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known \add any thing:\add* this
hath more rest than the other.
\p
\v 6 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice \add told,\add* yet hath he
seen no good: do not all go to one place? 
\v 7 All the labour of man \add is\add* for his mouth, and yet the appetite is
not filled. 
\v 8 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor, that
knoweth to walk before the living?
\p
\v 9 Better \add is\add* the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
desire: this \add is\add* also vanity and vexation of spirit. 
\v 10 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it 
\add is\add* man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he.
\p
\v 11 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what \add is
\add* man the better? 
\v 12 For who knoweth what \add is\add* good for man in \add this\add* life,
all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who can tell
a man what shall be after him under the sun?
\c 7
\p
\v 1 A good name \add is\add* better than precious ointment; and the day of
death than the day of one’s birth.
\p
\v 2 \add It is\add* better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay 
\add it\add* to his heart. 
\v 3 Sorrow \add is\add* better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
countenance the heart is made better. 
\v 4 The heart of the wise \add is\add* in the house of mourning; but the
heart of fools \add is\add* in the house of mirth. 
\v 5 \add It is\add* better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
hear the song of fools. 
\v 6 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so \add is\add* the laughter
of the fool: this also \add is\add* vanity.
\p
\v 7 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
heart. 
\v 8 Better \add is\add* the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: 
\add and\add* the patient in spirit \add is\add* better than the proud in
spirit. 
\v 9 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of
fools. 
\v 10 Say not thou, What is \add the cause\add* that the former days were
better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
\p
\v 11 Wisdom \add is\add* good with an inheritance: and \add by it there is
\add* profit to them that see the sun. 
\v 12 For wisdom \add is\add* a defence, \add and\add* money \add is
\add* a defence: but the excellency of knowledge \add is, that\add* wisdom
giveth life to them that have it. 
\v 13 Consider the work of God: for who can make \add that\add* straight,
which he hath made crooked? 
\v 14 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity
consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that
man should find nothing after him. 
\v 15 All \add things\add* have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a
just \add man\add* that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked
\add man\add* that prolongeth \add his life\add* in his wickedness. 
\v 16 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why
shouldest thou destroy thyself? 
\v 17 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die
before thy time? 
\v 18 \add It is\add* good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of
them all. 
\v 19 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty \add men\add* which
are in the city. 
\v 20 For \add there is\add* not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
sinneth not. 
\v 21 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy
servant curse thee: 
\v 22 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise
hast cursed others.
\p
\v 23 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it 
\add was\add* far from me. 
\v 24 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out? 
\v 25 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and
the reason \add of things,\add* and to know the wickedness of folly, even of
foolishness \add and\add* madness: 
\v 26 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart \add is
\add* snares and nets, \add and\add* her hands \add as\add* bands: whoso
pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her. 
\v 27 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, \add counting\add* one by
one, to find out the account: 
\v 28 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have
I found; but a woman among all those have I not found. 
\v 29 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they
have sought out many inventions.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Who \add is\add* as the wise \add man?\add* and who knoweth the
interpretation of a thing? a man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the
boldness of his face shall be changed. 
\v 2 I \add counsel thee\add* to keep the king’s commandment, and \add that
\add* in regard of the oath of God. 
\v 3 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he
doeth whatsoever pleaseth him. 
\v 4 Where the word of a king \add is, there is\add* power: and who may say
unto him, What doest thou? 
\v 5 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man’s
heart discerneth both time and judgment.
\p
\v 6 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery
of man \add is\add* great upon him. 
\v 7 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it
shall be? 
\v 8 \add There is\add* no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
spirit; neither \add hath he\add* power in the day of death: and \add there
is\add* no discharge in \add that\add* war; neither shall wickedness deliver
those that are given to it. 
\v 9 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done
under the sun: \add there is\add* a time wherein one man ruleth over another
to his own hurt. 
\v 10 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of
the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this 
\add is\add* also vanity. 
\v 11 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily,
therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
\p
\v 12 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his \add days\add* be
prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God,
which fear before him: 
\v 13 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong 
\add his\add* days, \add which are\add* as a shadow; because he feareth not
before God. 
\v 14 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just 
\add men,\add* unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked;
again, there be wicked \add men,\add* to whom it happeneth according to the
work of the righteous: I said that this also \add is\add* vanity. 
\v 15 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the
sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him
of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.
\p
\v 16 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that
is done upon the earth: (for also \add there is that\add* neither day nor
night seeth sleep with his eyes:) 
\v 17 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work
that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek \add it
\add* out, yet he shall not find \add it;\add* yea further; though a wise 
\add man\add* think to know \add it,\add* yet shall he not be able to find 
\add it.\add*
\c 9
\p
\v 1 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the
righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man
knoweth either love or hatred \add by\add* all \add that is\add* before them.
\v 2 All \add things come\add* alike to all: \add there is\add* one event to
the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the
unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as 
\add is\add* the good, so \add is\add* the sinner; \add and\add* he that
sweareth, as \add he\add* that feareth an oath. 
\v 3 This \add is\add* an evil among all \add things\add* that are done under
the sun, that \add there is\add* one event unto all: yea, also the heart of
the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they
live, and after that \add they go\add* to the dead.
\p
\v 4 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living
dog is better than a dead lion. 
\v 5 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing,
neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. 
\v 6 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished;
neither have they any more a portion for ever in any \add thing\add* that is
done under the sun.
\p
\v 7 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry
heart; for God now accepteth thy works. 
\v 8 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment. 
\v 9 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of
thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy
vanity: for that \add is\add* thy portion in \add this\add* life, and in thy
labour which thou takest under the sun. 
\v 10 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do \add it\add* with thy might; for 
\add there is\add* no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the
grave, whither thou goest.
\p
\v 11 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race \add is\add* not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet
riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and
chance happeneth to them all. 
\v 12 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are taken in an
evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so \add are
\add* the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly upon
them.
\p
\v 13 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it \add seemed
\add* great unto me: 
\v 14 \add There was\add* a little city, and few men within it; and there came
a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against
it: 
\v 15 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom
delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man. 
\v 16 Then said I, Wisdom \add is\add* better than strength: nevertheless the
poor man’s wisdom \add is\add* despised, and his words are not heard. 
\v 17 The words of wise \add men are\add* heard in quiet more than the cry of
him that ruleth among fools. 
\v 18 Wisdom \add is\add* better than weapons of war: but one sinner
destroyeth much good.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking
savour: \add so doth\add* a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom
\add and\add* honour. 
\v 2 A wise man’s heart \add is\add* at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at
his left. 
\v 3 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth 
\add him,\add* and he saith to every one \add that\add* he \add is\add* a
fool. 
\v 4 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for
yielding pacifieth great offences. 
\v 5 There is an evil \add which\add* I have seen under the sun, as an error 
\add which\add* proceedeth from the ruler: 
\v 6 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place. 
\v 7 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon
the earth. 
\v 8 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a
serpent shall bite him. 
\v 9 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; \add and\add* he that
cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby. 
\v 10 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to
more strength: but wisdom \add is\add* profitable to direct. 
\v 11 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no
better. 
\v 12 The words of a wise man’s mouth \add are\add* gracious; but the lips of
a fool will swallow up himself. 
\v 13 The beginning of the words of his mouth \add is\add* foolishness: and
the end of his talk \add is\add* mischievous madness. 
\v 14 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what
shall be after him, who can tell him? 
\v 15 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth
not how to go to the city.
\p
\v 16 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king \add is\add* a child, and thy princes
eat in the morning! 
\v 17 Blessed \add art\add* thou, O land, when thy king \add is\add* the son
of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
drunkenness!
\p
\v 18 By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the
hands the house droppeth through.
\p
\v 19 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth
all \add things.\add*
\p
\v 20 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy
bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath
wings shall tell the matter.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days. 
\v 2 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what
evil shall be upon the earth. 
\v 3 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty \add themselves\add* upon the
earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the
place where the tree falleth, there it shall be. 
\v 4 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the
clouds shall not reap. 
\v 5 As thou knowest not what \add is\add* the way of the spirit, \add nor
\add* how the bones \add do grow\add* in the womb of her that is with child:
even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all. 
\v 6 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand:
for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether
they both \add shall be\add* alike good.
\p
\v 7 Truly the light \add is\add* sweet, and a pleasant \add thing it is
\add* for the eyes to behold the sun: 
\v 8 But if a man live many years, \add and\add* rejoice in them all; yet let
him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh 
\add is\add* vanity.
\p
\v 9 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the
days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of
thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these \add things\add* God will bring
thee into judgment. 
\v 10 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy
flesh: for childhood and youth \add are\add* vanity.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days
come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in
them; 
\v 2 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not darkened,
nor the clouds return after the rain: 
\v 3 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong
men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and
those that look out of the windows be darkened, 
\v 4 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of the
grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird, and all the
daughters of musick shall be brought low; 
\v 5 Also \add when\add* they shall be afraid of \add that which is
\add* high, and fears \add shall be\add* in the way, and the almond tree shall
flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:
because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the streets: 
\v 6 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the
pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern. 
\v 7 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the spirit shall
return unto God who gave it.
\p
\v 8 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all \add is\add* vanity. 
\v 9 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people
knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out, \add and\add* set in order
many proverbs. 
\v 10 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and \add that which
was\add* written \add was\add* upright, \add even\add* words of truth. 
\v 11 The words of the wise \add are\add* as goads, and as nails fastened by
the masters of assemblies, \add which\add* are given from one shepherd. 
\v 12 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books 
\add there is\add* no end; and much study \add is\add* a weariness of the
flesh.
\p
\v 13 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his
commandments: for this \add is\add* the whole \add duty\add* of man. 
\v 14 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing,
whether \add it be\add* good, or whether \add it be\add* evil.
