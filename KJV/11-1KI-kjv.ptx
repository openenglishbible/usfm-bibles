\p
\v 1 Now king David was old \add and\add* stricken in years; and they covered
him with clothes, but he gat no heat. 
\v 2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the
king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, and let her cherish
him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat. 
\v 3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and
found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king. 
\v 4 And the damsel \add was\add* very fair, and cherished the king, and
ministered to him: but the king knew her not.
\p
\v 5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king:
and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. 
\v 6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast
thou done so? and he also \add was a\add* very goodly \add man;\add* and 
\add his mother\add* bare him after Absalom. 
\v 7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the
priest: and they following Adonijah helped \add him. \add*
\v 8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the
prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which \add belonged
\add* to David, were not with Adonijah. 
\v 9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth,
which \add is\add* by En-rogel, and called all his brethren the king’s sons,
and all the men of Judah the king’s servants: 
\v 10 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his
brother, he called not.
\p
\v 11 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying,
Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith doth reign, and David our
lord knoweth \add it\add* not? 
\v 12 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou
mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon. 
\v 13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst not thou, my
lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son
shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah
reign? 
\v 14 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in
after thee, and confirm thy words.
\p
\v 15 And Bath-sheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the king was
very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto the king. 
\v 16 And Bath-sheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the king
said, What wouldest thou? 
\v 17 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto
thine handmaid, \add saying,\add* Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after
me, and he shall sit upon my throne. 
\v 18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king, thou
knowest \add it\add* not: 
\v 19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath
called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain
of the host: but Solomon thy servant hath he not called. 
\v 20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel \add are\add* upon
thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the
king after him. 
\v 21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with
his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be counted offenders.
\p
\v 22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet also
came in. 
\v 23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And when he
was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to
the ground. 
\v 24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign
after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? 
\v 25 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and
sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king’s sons, and the captains of
the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him,
and say, God save king Adonijah. 
\v 26 But me, \add even\add* me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called. 
\v 27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed 
\add it\add* unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the
king after him?
\p
\v 28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bath-sheba. And she came into
the king’s presence, and stood before the king. 
\v 29 And the king sware, and said, \add As\add* the LORD liveth, that hath
redeemed my soul out of all distress, 
\v 30 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly
Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my
stead; even so will I certainly do this day. 
\v 31 Then Bath-sheba bowed with \add her\add* face to the earth, and did
reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
\p
\v 32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet,
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king. 
\v 33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of your lord,
and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bring him down to
Gihon: 
\v 34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king
over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God save king Solomon. 
\v 35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon my
throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him to be ruler
over Israel and over Judah. 
\v 36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen: the
LORD God of my lord the king say so \add too. \add*
\v 37 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon,
and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David. 
\v 38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused
Solomon to ride upon king David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. 
\v 39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle, and
anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, God save
king Solomon. 
\v 40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes,
and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
\p
\v 41 And Adonijah and all the guests that \add were\add* with him heard 
\add it\add* as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound
of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore \add is this\add* noise of the city being
in an uproar? 
\v 42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest
came: and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou \add art\add* a valiant
man, and bringest good tidings. 
\v 43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord king David
hath made Solomon king. 
\v 44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the
Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule: 
\v 45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in
Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that the city rang
again. This \add is\add* the noise that ye have heard. 
\v 46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom. 
\v 47 And moreover the king’s servants came to bless our lord king David,
saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne
greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed. 
\v 48 And also thus said the king, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD God of
Israel, which hath given \add one\add* to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes
even seeing \add it. \add*
\v 49 And all the guests that \add were\add* with Adonijah were afraid, and
rose up, and went every man his way.
\p
\v 50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught
hold on the horns of the altar. 
\v 51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king Solomon:
for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king
Solomon swear unto me to day that he will not slay his servant with the
sword. 
\v 52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there shall not
an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall be found in him, he
shall die. 
\v 53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he
came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said unto him, Go to thine
house.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he charged
Solomon his son, saying, 
\v 2 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thyself
a man; 
\v 3 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his
statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it
is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou
doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: 
\v 4 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me, saying,
If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all
their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man
on the throne of Israel. 
\v 5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, 
\add and\add* what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto
Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, and shed
the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his girdle that 
\add was\add* about his loins, and in his shoes that \add were\add* on his
feet. 
\v 6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down
to the grave in peace. 
\v 7 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them
be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because
of Absalom thy brother. 
\v 8 And, behold, \add thou hast\add* with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I
went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by
the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword. 
\v 9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou \add art\add* a wise man,
and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring thou
down to the grave with blood. 
\v 10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David. 
\v 11 And the days that David reigned over Israel \add were\add* forty years:
seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in
Jerusalem.
\p
\v 12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom
was established greatly.
\p
\v 13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bath-sheba the mother of
Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably. 
\v 14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said, Say
on. 
\v 15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and \add that
\add* all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the
kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from the
LORD. 
\v 16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said unto him,
Say on. 
\v 17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he will not
say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife. 
\v 18 And Bath-sheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
\p
\v 19 Bath-sheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him for
Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto her, and
sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother; and
she sat on his right hand. 
\v 20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; \add I pray thee,
\add* say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I
will not say thee nay. 
\v 21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy
brother to wife. 
\v 22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou
ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom also; for he
\add is\add* mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the priest,
and for Joab the son of Zeruiah. 
\v 23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more
also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life. 
\v 24 Now therefore, \add as\add* the LORD liveth, which hath established me,
and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an house, as
he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day. 
\v 25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he
fell upon him that he died.
\p
\v 26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth, unto
thine own fields; for thou \add art\add* worthy of death: but I will not at
this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the Lord GOD
before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my
father was afflicted. 
\v 27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD; that he
might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the house of Eli
in Shiloh.
\p
\v 28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he
turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the LORD, and
caught hold on the horns of the altar. 
\v 29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the tabernacle of
the LORD; and, behold, \add he is\add* by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah
the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him. 
\v 30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto him, Thus
saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die here. And Benaiah
brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.
\v 31 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon him, and
bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from
me, and from the house of my father. 
\v 32 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell upon two
men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the sword, my father
David not knowing \add thereof, to wit,\add* Abner the son of Ner, captain of
the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of
Judah. 
\v 33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and upon the
head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed, and upon his
house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever from the LORD. 
\v 34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and slew him:
and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
\p
\v 35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host:
and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
\p
\v 36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Build thee
an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thence any whither. 
\v 37 For it shall be, \add that\add* on the day thou goest out, and passest
over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die:
thy blood shall be upon thine own head. 
\v 38 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying \add is\add* good: as my lord
the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many
days. 
\v 39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants
of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told
Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants \add be\add* in Gath. 
\v 40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achish to
seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath. 
\v 41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and
was come again. 
\v 42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did I not
make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying, Know for a
certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou
shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word \add that\add* I have
heard \add is\add* good. 
\v 43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the commandment
that I have charged thee with? 
\v 44 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which
thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the
LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; 
\v 45 And king Solomon \add shall be\add* blessed, and the throne of David
shall be established before the LORD for ever. 
\v 46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went out, and
fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of
Solomon.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh’s
daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of
building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem
round about. 
\v 2 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house
built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. 
\v 3 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father:
only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. 
\v 4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that \add was
\add* the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon
that altar.
\p
\v 5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said,
Ask what I shall give thee. 
\v 6 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my father great
mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and
in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great
kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as \add it is
\add* this day. 
\v 7 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David
my father: and I \add am but\add* a little child: I know not \add how
\add* to go out or come in. 
\v 8 And thy servant \add is\add* in the midst of thy people which thou hast
chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. 
\v 9 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people,
that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so
great a people? 
\v 10 And the speech pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing. 
\v 11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not
asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast
asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to
discern judgment; 
\v 12 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise
and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,
neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 
\v 13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches,
and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all
thy days. 
\v 14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thy days. 
\v 15 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, \add it was\add* a dream. And he came to
Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered
up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his
servants.
\p
\v 16 Then came there two women, \add that were\add* harlots, unto the king,
and stood before him. 
\v 17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house;
and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 
\v 18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this
woman was delivered also: and we \add were\add* together; \add there was
\add* no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. 
\v 19 And this woman’s child died in the night; because she overlaid it. 
\v 20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine
handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my
bosom. 
\v 21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was
dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son,
which I did bear. 
\v 22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living \add is\add* my son, and
the dead \add is\add* thy son. And this said, No; but the dead \add is
\add* thy son, and the living \add is\add* my son. Thus they spake before the
king. 
\v 23 Then said the king, The one saith, This \add is\add* my son that liveth,
and thy son \add is\add* the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son 
\add is\add* the dead, and my son \add is\add* the living. 
\v 24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the
king. 
\v 25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the
one, and half to the other. 
\v 26 Then spake the woman whose the living child \add was\add* unto the king,
for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the
living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither
mine nor thine, \add but\add* divide \add it. \add*
\v 27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no
wise slay it: she \add is\add* the mother thereof. 
\v 28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they
feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God \add was\add* in him, to
do judgment.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel. 
\v 2 And these \add were\add* the princes which he had; Azariah the son of
Zadok the priest, 
\v 3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the son of
Ahilud, the recorder. 
\v 4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada \add was\add* over the host: and Zadok
and Abiathar \add were\add* the priests: 
\v 5 And Azariah the son of Nathan \add was\add* over the officers: and Zabud
the son of Nathan \add was\add* principal officer, \add and\add* the king’s
friend: 
\v 6 And Ahishar \add was\add* over the household: and Adoniram the son of
Abda \add was\add* over the tribute. 
\v 7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided victuals
for the king and his household: each man his month in a year made provision. 
\v 8 And these \add are\add* their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 
\v 9 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Beth-shemesh, and
Elon-beth-hanan: 
\v 10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him \add pertained\add* Sochoh, and all
the land of Hepher: 
\v 11 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath the
daughter of Solomon to wife: 
\v 12 Baana the son of Ahilud; \add to him pertained\add* Taanach and Megiddo,
and all Beth-shean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Beth-shean to
Abel-meholah, \add even\add* unto \add the place that is\add* beyond Jokneam:
\v 13 The son of Geber, in Ramoth-gilead; to him \add pertained\add* the towns
of Jair the son of Manasseh, which \add are\add* in Gilead; to him \add also
pertained\add* the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great
cities with walls and brasen bars: 
\v 14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo \add had\add* Mahanaim: 
\v 15 Ahimaaz \add was\add* in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
Solomon to wife: 
\v 16 Baanah the son of Hushai \add was\add* in Asher and in Aloth: 
\v 17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 
\v 18 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin: 
\v 19 Geber the son of Uri \add was\add* in the country of Gilead, \add in
\add* the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and
\add he was\add* the only officer which \add was\add* in the land.
\p
\v 20 Judah and Israel \add were\add* many, as the sand which \add is
\add* by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry. 
\v 21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of
the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought presents, and
served Solomon all the days of his life.
\p
\v 22 And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour,
and threescore measures of meal, 
\v 23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep,
beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl. 
\v 24 For he had dominion over all \add the region\add* on this side the
river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river:
and he had peace on all sides round about him. 
\v 25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under
his fig tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.
\p
\v 26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots, and
twelve thousand horsemen. 
\v 27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that
came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they lacked nothing. 
\v 28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto
the place where \add the officers\add* were, every man according to his
charge.
\p
\v 29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and
largeness of heart, even as the sand that \add is\add* on the sea shore. 
\v 30 And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east
country, and all the wisdom of Egypt. 
\v 31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and
Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in all nations round
about. 
\v 32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and
five. 
\v 33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that \add is\add* in Lebanon
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of beasts,
and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes. 
\v 34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all
kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he had heard
that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever
a lover of David. 
\v 2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
\v 3 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house unto the
name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side,
until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet. 
\v 4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, \add so that
there is\add* neither adversary nor evil occurrent. 
\v 5 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORD my
God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set
upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house unto my name. 
\v 6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon;
and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will I give hire for
thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that 
\add there is\add* not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the
Sidonians.
\p
\v 7 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he
rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD this day, which hath
given unto David a wise son over this great people. 
\v 8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which
thou sentest to me for: \add and\add* I will do all thy desire concerning
timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir. 
\v 9 My servants shall bring \add them\add* down from Lebanon unto the sea:
and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint
me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive 
\add them:\add* and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my
household. 
\v 10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees \add according to
\add* all his desire. 
\v 11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat \add for
\add* food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave
Solomon to Hiram year by year. 
\v 12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was
peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.
\p
\v 13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was
thirty thousand men. 
\v 14 And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses: a month
they were in Lebanon, \add and\add* two months at home: and Adoniram 
\add was\add* over the levy. 
\v 15 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens, and
fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 
\v 16 Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which \add were\add* over the
work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that
wrought in the work. 
\v 17 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, 
\add and\add* hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house. 
\v 18 And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew \add them,
\add* and the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the
house.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the
children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of
Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which \add is\add* the second
month, that he began to build the house of the LORD. 
\v 2 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof 
\add was\add* threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty \add cubits,
\add* and the height thereof thirty cubits. 
\v 3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits \add was
\add* the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; \add and
\add* ten cubits \add was\add* the breadth thereof before the house. 
\v 4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
\p
\v 5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, 
\add against\add* the walls of the house round about, \add both\add* of the
temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about: 
\v 6 The nethermost chamber \add was\add* five cubits broad, and the middle 
\add was\add* six cubits broad, and the third \add was\add* seven cubits
broad: for without \add in the wall\add* of the house he made narrowed rests
round about, that \add the beams\add* should not be fastened in the walls of
the house. 
\v 7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready
before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor axe 
\add nor\add* any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building. 
\v 8 The door for the middle chamber \add was\add* in the right side of the
house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle \add chamber,
\add* and out of the middle into the third. 
\v 9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams
and boards of cedar. 
\v 10 And \add then\add* he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
high: and they rested on the house \add with\add* timber of cedar.
\p
\v 11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 
\v 12 \add Concerning\add* this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt
walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to
walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spake unto David
thy father: 
\v 13 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my
people Israel. 
\v 14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it. 
\v 15 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both
the floor of the house, and the walls of the cieling: \add and\add* he covered
\add them\add* on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house
with planks of fir. 
\v 16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and
the walls with boards of cedar: he even built \add them\add* for it within, 
\add even\add* for the oracle, \add even\add* for the most holy \add place. 
\add*
\v 17 And the house, that \add is,\add* the temple before it, was forty cubits
\add long. \add*
\v 18 And the cedar of the house within \add was\add* carved with knops and
open flowers: all \add was\add* cedar; there was no stone seen. 
\v 19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of
the covenant of the LORD. 
\v 20 And the oracle in the forepart \add was\add* twenty cubits in length,
and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he
overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar \add which was of
\add* cedar. 
\v 21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a
partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with
gold. 
\v 22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the
house: also the whole altar that \add was\add* by the oracle he overlaid with
gold.
\p
\v 23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims \add of\add* olive tree, 
\add each\add* ten cubits high. 
\v 24 And five cubits \add was\add* the one wing of the cherub, and five
cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing
unto the uttermost part of the other \add were\add* ten cubits. 
\v 25 And the other cherub \add was\add* ten cubits: both the cherubims 
\add were\add* of one measure and one size. 
\v 26 The height of the one cherub \add was\add* ten cubits, and so 
\add was it\add* of the other cherub. 
\v 27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they stretched
forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the 
\add one\add* wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall;
and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house. 
\v 28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold. 
\v 29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures
of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without. 
\v 30 And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
\p
\v 31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors \add of\add* olive
tree: the lintel \add and\add* side posts \add were\add* a fifth part 
\add of the wall. \add*
\v 32 The two doors also \add were of\add* olive tree; and he carved upon them
carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid 
\add them\add* with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the
palm trees. 
\v 33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth
part \add of the wall. \add*
\v 34 And the two doors \add were of\add* fir tree: the two leaves of the one
door \add were\add* folding, and the two leaves of the other door \add were
\add* folding. 
\v 35 And he carved \add thereon\add* cherubims and palm trees and open
flowers: and covered \add them\add* with gold fitted upon the carved work.
\p
\v 36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row
of cedar beams.
\p
\v 37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in
the month Zif: 
\v 38 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which \add is\add* the
eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and
according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished
all his house.
\p
\v 2 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof 
\add was\add* an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the
height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar
beams upon the pillars. 
\v 3 And \add it was\add* covered with cedar above upon the beams, that 
\add lay\add* on forty five pillars, fifteen \add in\add* a row. 
\v 4 And \add there were\add* windows \add in\add* three rows, and light 
\add was\add* against light \add in\add* three ranks. 
\v 5 And all the doors and posts \add were\add* square, with the windows: and
light \add was\add* against light \add in\add* three ranks.
\p
\v 6 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof \add was\add* fifty
cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them:
and the \add other\add* pillars and the thick beam \add were\add* before
them.
\p
\v 7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, \add even
\add* the porch of judgment: and \add it was\add* covered with cedar from one
side of the floor to the other.
\p
\v 8 And his house where he dwelt \add had\add* another court within the
porch, \add which\add* was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for
Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken \add to wife,\add* like unto this
porch. 
\v 9 All these \add were of\add* costly stones, according to the measures of
hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation
unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court. 
\v 10 And the foundation \add was of\add* costly stones, even great stones,
stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 
\v 11 And above \add were\add* costly stones, after the measures of hewed
stones, and cedars. 
\v 12 And the great court round about \add was\add* with three rows of hewed
stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the
LORD, and for the porch of the house.
\p
\v 13 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre. 
\v 14 He \add was\add* a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
\add was\add* a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom,
and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king
Solomon, and wrought all his work. 
\v 15 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a
line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about. 
\v 16 And he made two chapiters \add of\add* molten brass, to set upon the
tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter \add was\add* five cubits,
and the height of the other chapiter \add was\add* five cubits: 
\v 17 \add And\add* nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the
chapiters which \add were\add* upon the top of the pillars; seven for the one
chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. 
\v 18 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one network,
to cover the chapiters that \add were\add* upon the top, with pomegranates:
and so did he for the other chapiter. 
\v 19 And the chapiters that \add were\add* upon the top of the pillars 
\add were\add* of lily work in the porch, four cubits. 
\v 20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars \add had pomegranates\add* also
above, over against the belly which \add was\add* by the network: and the
pomegranates \add were\add* two hundred in rows round about upon the other
chapiter. 
\v 21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the
right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left
pillar, and he called the name thereof Boaz. 
\v 22 And upon the top of the pillars \add was\add* lily work: so was the work
of the pillars finished.
\p
\v 23 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: 
\add it was\add* round all about, and his height \add was\add* five cubits:
and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. 
\v 24 And under the brim of it round about \add there were\add* knops
compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops 
\add were\add* cast in two rows, when it was cast. 
\v 25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three
looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking
toward the east: and the sea \add was set\add* above upon them, and all their
hinder parts \add were\add* inward. 
\v 26 And it \add was\add* an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two
thousand baths.
\p
\v 27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits \add was\add* the length of
one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of
it. 
\v 28 And the work of the bases \add was\add* on this \add manner:\add* they
had borders, and the borders \add were\add* between the ledges: 
\v 29 And on the borders that \add were\add* between the ledges \add were
\add* lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges \add there was
\add* a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen \add were\add* certain
additions made of thin work. 
\v 30 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four
corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver \add were\add* undersetters
molten, at the side of every addition. 
\v 31 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above \add was\add* a cubit:
but the mouth thereof \add was\add* round \add after\add* the work of the
base, a cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it \add were\add*
gravings with their borders, foursquare, not round. 
\v 32 And under the borders \add were\add* four wheels; and the axletrees of
the wheels \add were joined\add* to the base: and the height of a wheel 
\add was\add* a cubit and a half a cubit. 
\v 33 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their
axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, \add were
\add* all molten. 
\v 34 And \add there were\add* four undersetters to the four corners of one
base: \add and\add* the undersetters \add were\add* of the very base itself. 
\v 35 And in the top of the base \add was there\add* a round compass of half a
cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders
thereof \add were\add* of the same. 
\v 36 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he
graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every
one, and additions round about. 
\v 37 After this \add manner\add* he made the ten bases: all of them had one
casting, one measure, \add and\add* one size.
\p
\v 38 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: 
\add and\add* every laver was four cubits: \add and\add* upon every one of the
ten bases one laver. 
\v 39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the
left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house
eastward over against the south.
\p
\v 40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So Hiram
made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of
the LORD: 
\v 41 The two pillars, and the \add two\add* bowls of the chapiters that 
\add were\add* on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover
the two bowls of the chapiters which \add were\add* upon the top of the
pillars; 
\v 42 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, \add even
\add* two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the
chapiters that \add were\add* upon the pillars; 
\v 43 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 
\v 44 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea; 
\v 45 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these vessels,
which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, \add were of
\add* bright brass. 
\v 46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground
between Succoth and Zarthan. 
\v 47 And Solomon left all the vessels \add unweighed,\add* because they were
exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out. 
\v 48 And Solomon made all the vessels that \add pertained\add* unto the house
of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the shewbread
\add was, \add*
\v 49 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right \add side,
\add* and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the
lamps, and the tongs \add of\add* gold, 
\v 50 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
censers \add of\add* pure gold; and the hinges \add of\add* gold, \add both
\add* for the doors of the inner house, the most holy \add place, and
\add* for the doors of the house, \add to wit,\add* of the temple. 
\v 51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the
LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated;
\add even\add* the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the
treasures of the house of the LORD.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the
tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto king Solomon
in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out
of the city of David, which \add is\add* Zion. 
\v 2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomon at the
feast in the month Ethanim, which \add is\add* the seventh month. 
\v 3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. 
\v 4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of the
congregation, and all the holy vessels that \add were\add* in the tabernacle,
even those did the priests and the Levites bring up. 
\v 5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that \add were
\add* assembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and
oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude. 
\v 6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his
place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy \add place, even
\add* under the wings of the cherubims. 
\v 7 For the cherubims spread forth \add their\add* two wings over the place
of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above. 
\v 8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were seen out
in the holy \add place\add* before the oracle, and they were not seen without:
and there they are unto this day. 
\v 9 \add There was\add* nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone,
which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made \add a covenant\add* with
the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy 
\add place,\add* that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 
\v 11 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud:
for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
\p
\v 12 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thick
darkness. 
\v 13 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place for thee
to abide in for ever. 
\v 14 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of
Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;) 
\v 15 And he said, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD God of Israel, which spake
with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled 
\add it,\add* saying, 
\v 16 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I
chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build an house, that my name
might be therein; but I chose David to be over my people Israel. 
\v 17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house for the
name of the LORD God of Israel. 
\v 18 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thine heart to
build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was in thine heart. 
\v 19 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that shall come
forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto my name. 
\v 20 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am risen up in
the room of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD
promised, and have built an house for the name of the LORD God of Israel. 
\v 21 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein \add is\add* the
covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them out
of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all
the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven: 
\v 23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, \add there is\add* no God like thee, in
heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy
servants that walk before thee with all their heart: 
\v 24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou promisedst him:
thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilled \add it\add* with thine
hand, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 25 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father
that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee a man in my sight
to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy children take heed to their way,
that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me. 
\v 26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified, which
thou spakest unto thy servant David my father. 
\v 27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and heaven of
heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have builded? 
\v 28 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to his
supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer, which
thy servant prayeth before thee to day: 
\v 29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, \add even
\add* toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: that
thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this
place. 
\v 30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people
Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thou in heaven thy
dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
\p
\v 31 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon him
to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house: 
\v 32 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, condemning the
wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and justifying the righteous, to give
him according to his righteousness.
\p
\v 33 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, because they
have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, and confess thy name,
and pray, and make supplication unto thee in this house: 
\v 34 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and
bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers.
\p
\v 35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they have sinned
against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thy name, and turn
from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 
\v 36 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of
thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk,
and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an
inheritance.
\p
\v 37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,
mildew, locust, \add or\add* if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiege
them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness 
\add there be; \add*
\v 38 What prayer and supplication soever be \add made\add* by any man, 
\add or\add* by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague
of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house: 
\v 39 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and
give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou,
\add even\add* thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;) 
\v 40 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which
thou gavest unto our fathers. 
\v 41 Moreover concerning a stranger, that \add is\add* not of thy people
Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name’s sake; 
\v 42 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of
thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house; 
\v 43 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the
stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earth may know thy name,
to fear thee, as \add do\add* thy people Israel; and that they may know that
this house, which I have builded, is called by thy name.
\p
\v 44 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoever thou
shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the city which thou hast
chosen, and \add toward\add* the house that I have built for thy name: 
\v 45 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and
maintain their cause. 
\v 46 If they sin against thee, (for \add there is\add* no man that sinneth
not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they
carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near; 
\v 47 \add Yet\add* if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee in the land
of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned, and have done
perversely, we have committed wickedness; 
\v 48 And \add so\add* return unto thee with all their heart, and with all
their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away captive, and
pray unto thee toward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the
city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name: 
\v 49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy
dwelling place, and maintain their cause, 
\v 50 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their
transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee, and give them
compassion before them who carried them captive, that they may have compassion
on them: 
\v 51 For they \add be\add* thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron: 
\v 52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant, and
unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that
they call for unto thee. 
\v 53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth, 
\add to be\add* thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy
servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD. 
\v 54 And it was \add so,\add* that when Solomon had made an end of praying
all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before the altar
of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven. 
\v 55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud
voice, saying, 
\v 56 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people
Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not failed one word of
all his good promise, which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant. 
\v 57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not
leave us, nor forsake us: 
\v 58 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to
keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded
our fathers. 
\v 59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication before the
LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that he maintain the cause
of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel at all times, as the matter
shall require: 
\v 60 That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD \add is
\add* God, \add and that there is\add* none else. 
\v 61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to walk in
his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
\p
\v 62 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the
LORD. 
\v 63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he offered
unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty
thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israel dedicated the house
of the LORD. 
\v 64 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that 
\add was\add* before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the
brasen altar that \add was\add* before the LORD \add was\add* too little to
receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace
offerings. 
\v 65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great
congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before
the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, \add even\add* fourteen days. 
\v 66 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed the king,
and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that
the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israel his people.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of the house
of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all Solomon’s desire which he was
pleased to do, 
\v 2 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had appeared
unto him at Gibeon. 
\v 3 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication,
that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house, which thou hast
built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be
there perpetually. 
\v 4 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in integrity
of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded
thee, \add and\add* wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: 
\v 5 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever, as
I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon
the throne of Israel. 
\v 6 \add But\add* if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
children, and will not keep my commandments \add and\add* my statutes which I
have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them: 
\v 7 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them; and
this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out of my sight;
and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people: 
\v 8 And at this house, \add which\add* is high, every one that passeth by it
shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the LORD
done thus unto this land, and to this house? 
\v 9 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, who
brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon
other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them: therefore hath the LORD
brought upon them all this evil.
\p
\v 10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built
the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, 
\v 11 (\add Now\add* Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that then
king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 
\v 12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given
him; and they pleased him not. 
\v 13 And he said, What cities \add are\add* these which thou hast given me,
my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day. 
\v 14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
\p
\v 15 And this \add is\add* the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised;
for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall
of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. 
\v 16 \add For\add* Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and
burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given
it \add for\add* a present unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife. 
\v 17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Beth-horon the nether, 
\v 18 and Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 
\v 19 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his
chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build
in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. 
\v 20 \add And\add* all the people \add that were\add* left of the Amorites,
Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which \add were\add* not of the
children of Israel, 
\v 21 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children
of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a
tribute of bondservice unto this day. 
\v 22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they 
\add were\add* men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his
captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. 
\v 23 These \add were\add* the chief of the officers that \add were
\add* over Solomon’s work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the
people that wrought in the work.
\p
\v 24 But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house
which \add Solomon\add* had built for her: then did he build Millo.
\p
\v 25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace
offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense
upon the altar that \add was\add* before the LORD. So he finished the house.
\p
\v 26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside
Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom. 
\v 27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of
the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 
\v 28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and
twenty talents, and brought \add it\add* to king Solomon.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the
name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. 
\v 2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bare
spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to
Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 
\v 3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not \add any
\add* thing hid from the king, which he told her not. 
\v 4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom, and the house
that he had built, 
\v 5 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the
attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his
ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more
spirit in her. 
\v 6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own
land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. 
\v 7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen 
\add it:\add* and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity
exceedeth the fame which I heard. 
\v 8 Happy \add are\add* thy men, happy \add are\add* these thy servants,
which stand continually before thee, \add and\add* that hear thy wisdom. 
\v 9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the
throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever, therefore made he
thee king, to do judgment and justice. 
\v 10 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of
spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such
abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to king Solomon. 
\v 11 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir, brought in
from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. 
\v 12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD,
and for the king’s house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no
such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day. 
\v 13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatsoever
she asked, beside \add that\add* which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty.
So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
\p
\v 14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred
threescore and six talents of gold. 
\v 15 Beside \add that he had\add* of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of
the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of
the country.
\p
\v 16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred 
\add shekels\add* of gold went to one target. 
\v 17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold
went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of
Lebanon.
\p
\v 18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the
best gold. 
\v 19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne \add was\add* round
behind: and \add there were\add* stays on either side on the place of the
seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. 
\v 20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the
six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
\p
\v 21 And all king Solomon’s drinking vessels \add were of\add* gold, and all
the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon \add were of\add* pure gold;
none \add were of\add* silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of
Solomon. 
\v 22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once
in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory,
and apes, and peacocks. 
\v 23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for
wisdom.
\p
\v 24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had
put in his heart. 
\v 25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels
of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year
by year.
\p
\v 26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a
thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he
bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem. 
\v 27 And the king made silver \add to be\add* in Jerusalem as stones, and
cedars made he \add to be\add* as the sycomore trees that \add are\add* in the
vale, for abundance.
\p
\v 28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king’s
merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
\v 29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred \add shekels
\add* of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the
kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring \add them
\add* out by their means.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of
Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, \add and
\add* Hittites; 
\v 2 Of the nations \add concerning\add* which the LORD said unto the children
of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: 
\add for\add* surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon
clave unto these in love. 
\v 3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines:
and his wives turned away his heart. 
\v 4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, \add that\add* his wives
turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the
LORD his God, as \add was\add* the heart of David his father. 
\v 5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after
Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
\v 6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after
the LORD, as \add did\add* David his father. 
\v 7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of
Moab, in the hill that \add is\add* before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the
abomination of the children of Ammon. 
\v 8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and
sacrificed unto their gods. 
\v 9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned from
the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, 
\v 10 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after
other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded. 
\v 11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee,
and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded
thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy
servant. 
\v 12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy father’s
sake: \add but\add* I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. 
\v 13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; \add but\add* will give
one tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake
which I have chosen.
\p
\v 14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he
\add was\add* of the king’s seed in Edom. 
\v 15 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the
host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom; 
\v 16 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he had cut
off every male in Edom:) 
\v 17 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with
him, to go into Egypt; Hadad \add being\add* yet a little child. 
\v 18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took men with
them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt; which
gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. 
\v 19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave
him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 
\v 20 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes
weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the
sons of Pharaoh. 
\v 21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and
that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me
depart, that I may go to mine own country. 
\v 22 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that,
behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing:
howbeit let me go in any wise.
\p
\v 23 And God stirred him up \add another\add* adversary, Rezon the son of
Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 
\v 24 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when David
slew them \add of Zobah:\add* and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein,
and reigned in Damascus. 
\v 25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, beside the
mischief that Hadad \add did:\add* and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over
Syria.
\p
\v 26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s
servant, whose mother’s name \add was\add* Zeruah, a widow woman, even he
lifted up \add his\add* hand against the king. 
\v 27 And this \add was\add* the cause that he lifted up \add his\add* hand
against the king: Solomon built Millo, \add and\add* repaired the breaches of
the city of David his father. 
\v 28 And the man Jeroboam \add was\add* a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the
charge of the house of Joseph. 
\v 29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem,
that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad
himself with a new garment; and they two \add were\add* alone in the field: 
\v 30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that \add was\add* on him, and rent it
\add in\add* twelve pieces: 
\v 31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD,
the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon,
and will give ten tribes to thee: 
\v 32 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and for
Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of
Israel:) 
\v 33 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the
goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god
of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do \add that
which is\add* right in mine eyes, and \add to keep\add* my statutes and my
judgments, as \add did\add* David his father. 
\v 34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will
make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s sake, whom I
chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: 
\v 35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto
thee, \add even\add* ten tribes. 
\v 36 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant may have a
light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my
name there. 
\v 37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy
soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel. 
\v 38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and
wilt walk in my ways, and do \add that is\add* right in my sight, to keep my
statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I will be with
thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel
unto thee. 
\v 39 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever. 
\v 40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled
into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of
Solomon.
\p
\v 41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his
wisdom, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 
\v 42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel 
\add was\add* forty years. 
\v 43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David
his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make
him king. 
\v 2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in
Egypt, heard \add of it,\add* (for he was fled from the presence of king
Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 
\v 3 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of
Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying, 
\v 4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the grievous
service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and
we will serve thee. 
\v 5 And he said unto them, Depart yet \add for\add* three days, then come
again to me. And the people departed.
\p
\v 6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon
his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer
this people? 
\v 7 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant unto this
people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to
them, then they will be thy servants for ever. 
\v 8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and
consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, \add and\add* which
stood before him: 
\v 9 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this
people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father did put
upon us lighter? 
\v 10 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying,
Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thy
father made our yoke heavy, but make thou \add it\add* lighter unto us; thus
shalt thou say unto them, My little \add finger\add* shall be thicker than my
father’s loins. 
\v 11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to
your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you
with scorpions.
\p
\v 12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the
king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day. 
\v 13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s
counsel that they gave him; 
\v 14 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father
made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father \add also
\add* chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions. 
\v 15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the cause was from
the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spake by Ahijah the
Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
\p
\v 16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them, the people
answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither \add have
we\add* inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to
thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents. 
\v 17 But \add as for\add* the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them. 
\v 18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who \add was\add* over the tribute; and
all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made
speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem. 
\v 19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day. 
\v 20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again,
that they sent and called him unto the congregation, and made him king over
all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of
Judah only.
\p
\v 21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of
Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen
men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the
kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. 
\v 22 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying, 
\v 23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the
house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying, 
\v 24 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren
the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from
me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart,
according to the word of the LORD.
\p
\v 25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein; and
went out from thence, and built Penuel. 
\v 26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the
house of David: 
\v 27 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at
Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord, 
\add even\add* unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go
again to Rehoboam king of Judah. 
\v 28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves \add of\add* gold,
and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy
gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 29 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan. 
\v 30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went \add to worship
\add* before the one, \add even\add* unto Dan. 
\v 31 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of
the people, which were not of the sons of Levi. 
\v 32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day
of the month, like unto the feast that \add is\add* in Judah, and he offered
upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had
made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had
made. 
\v 33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth
day of the eighth month, \add even\add* in the month which he had devised of
his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children of Israel: and he
offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word of the LORD
unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense. 
\v 2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said, O
altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born unto the
house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer the priests of
the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall be burnt
upon thee. 
\v 3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This \add is\add* the sign which
the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that 
\add are\add* upon it shall be poured out. 
\v 4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the man of
God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand
from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth
against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him. 
\v 5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,
according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the LORD.
\v 6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face
of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.
And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king’s hand was restored him
again, and became as \add it was\add* before. 
\v 7 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh
thyself, and I will give thee a reward. 
\v 8 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thine
house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in
this place: 
\v 9 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no bread,
nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou camest. 
\v 10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to
Bethel.
\p
\v 11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and told him
all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: the words which
he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to their father. 
\v 12 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons had seen
what way the man of God went, which came from Judah. 
\v 13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the
ass: and he rode thereon, 
\v 14 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak: and
he said unto him, \add Art\add* thou the man of God that camest from Judah?
And he said, I \add am. \add*
\v 15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread. 
\v 16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee: neither
will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 
\v 17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat no bread
nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest. 
\v 18 He said unto him, I \add am\add* a prophet also as thou \add art;
\add* and an angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him
back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. 
\add But\add* he lied unto him. 
\v 19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank
water.
\p
\v 20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the LORD
came unto the prophet that brought him back: 
\v 21 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus
saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and
hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 
\v 22 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of
the which \add the LORD\add* did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no
water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
\p
\v 23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk,
that he saddled for him the ass, \add to wit,\add* for the prophet whom he had
brought back. 
\v 24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his
carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion also stood by
the carcase. 
\v 25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the
lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in the city where the
old prophet dwelt. 
\v 26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard 
\add thereof,\add* he said, It \add is\add* the man of God, who was
disobedient unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him
unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of
the LORD, which he spake unto him. 
\v 27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they saddled 
\add him. \add*
\v 28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the
lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the carcase, nor torn the
ass. 
\v 29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid it upon
the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the city, to mourn
and to bury him. 
\v 30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over him, 
\add saying,\add* Alas, my brother! 
\v 31 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to his sons,
saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God 
\add is\add* buried; lay my bones beside his bones: 
\v 32 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against the altar
in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which \add are
\add* in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
\p
\v 33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again
of the lowest of the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he
consecrated him, and he became \add one\add* of the priests of the high
places. 
\v 34 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut 
\add it\add* off, and to destroy \add it\add* from off the face of the earth.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 
\v 2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself,
that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh:
behold, there \add is\add* Ahijah the prophet, which told me that \add I
should be\add* king over this people. 
\v 3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and
go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child. 
\v 4 And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to
the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason
of his age.
\p
\v 5 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask
a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto
her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself 
\add to be\add* another \add woman. \add*
\v 6 And it was \add so,\add* when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she
came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why
feignest thou thyself \add to be\add* another? for I \add am\add* sent to
thee \add with\add* heavy \add tidings. \add*
\v 7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch as I
exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people
Israel, 
\v 8 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it thee: and
yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my commandments, and who
followed me with all his heart, to do \add that\add* only \add which was
\add* right in mine eyes; 
\v 9 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone
and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast
cast me behind thy back: 
\v 10 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and
will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, \add and
\add* him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the remnant
of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone. 
\v 11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that
dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken
it. 
\v 12 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: \add and\add* when
thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. 
\v 13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of
Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found \add some
\add* good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam. 
\v 14 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who shall cut
off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. 
\v 15 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the water, and
he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers,
and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves,
provoking the LORD to anger. 
\v 16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did
sin, and who made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 17 And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: \add and
\add* when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 
\v 18 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the
word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the
prophet. 
\v 19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned,
behold, they \add are\add* written in the book of the chronicles of the kings
of Israel. 
\v 20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned \add were\add* two and twenty years:
and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam \add was
\add* forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen
years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes
of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name \add was\add* Naamah
an Ammonitess. 
\v 22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to
jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their
fathers had done. 
\v 23 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every
high hill, and under every green tree. 
\v 24 And there were also sodomites in the land: \add and\add* they did
according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out
before the children of Israel.
\p
\v 25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, \add that
\add* Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 
\v 26 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the
treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took away all the
shields of gold which Solomon had made. 
\v 27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed 
\add them\add* unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door
of the king’s house. 
\v 28 And it was \add so,\add* when the king went into the house of the LORD,
that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber.
\p
\v 29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, \add are
\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
\v 30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all \add their
\add* days. 
\v 31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in
the city of David. And his mother’s name \add was\add* Naamah an Ammonitess.
And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat reigned
Abijam over Judah. 
\v 2 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name \add was
\add* Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
\v 3 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before
him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as the heart of
David his father. 
\v 4 Nevertheless for David’s sake did the LORD his God give him a lamp in
Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establish Jerusalem: 
\v 5 Because David did \add that which was\add* right in the eyes of the LORD,
and turned not aside from any \add thing\add* that he commanded him all the
days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. 
\v 6 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his
life. 
\v 7 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, \add are
\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
\v 8 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the city of
David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over
Judah. 
\v 10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name 
\add was\add* Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
\v 11 And Asa did \add that which was\add* right in the eyes of the LORD, as 
\add did\add* David his father. 
\v 12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed all the
idols that his fathers had made. 
\v 13 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from \add being
\add* queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her
idol, and burnt \add it\add* by the brook Kidron. 
\v 14 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa’s heart was
perfect with the LORD all his days. 
\v 15 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, and the
things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD, silver, and
gold, and vessels.
\p
\v 16 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\v 17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built Ramah, that
he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. 
\v 18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold \add that were\add* left in
the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house,
and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to
Ben-hadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt
at Damascus, saying, 
\v 19 \add There is\add* a league between me and thee, \add and\add* between
my father and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of silver
and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may
depart from me. 
\v 20 So Ben- hadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of the
hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, and Dan, and
Abel-beth-maachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. 
\v 21 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard \add thereof,\add* that he left
off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah. 
\v 22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none \add was
\add* exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timber
thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with them Geba of
Benjamin, and Mizpah. 
\v 23 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all that he did,
and the cities which he built, \add are\add* they not written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the time of his old age
he was diseased in his feet. 
\v 24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the
city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 25 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second
year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years. 
\v 26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his
father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
\p
\v 27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired
against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which \add belonged
\add* to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege to Gibbethon. 
\v 28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him, and
reigned in his stead. 
\v 29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, \add that\add* he smote all the
house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until he had
destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which he spake by his
servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 
\v 30 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made
Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to
anger.
\p
\v 31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, \add are
\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.
\v 33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of Ahijah to
reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years. 
\v 34 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of
Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha,
saying, 
\v 2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee prince over my
people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my
people Israel to sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins; 
\v 3 Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the posterity of
his house; and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat. 
\v 4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that
dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat. 
\v 5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his might, 
\add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel? 
\v 6 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah: and Elah his
son reigned in his stead. 
\v 7 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani came the word
of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even for all the evil that
he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of
his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.
\p
\v 8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah the son of
Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years. 
\v 9 And his servant Zimri, captain of half \add his\add* chariots, conspired
against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza
steward of \add his\add* house in Tirzah. 
\v 10 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty and
seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his
throne, \add that\add* he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him not one
that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of his friends. 
\v 12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of
the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, 
\v 13 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by which they
sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provoking the LORD God of
Israel to anger with their vanities. 
\v 14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, \add are
\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\p
\v 15 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri reign
seven days in Tirzah. And the people \add were\add* encamped against
Gibbethon, which \add belonged\add* to the Philistines. 
\v 16 And the people \add that were\add* encamped heard say, Zimri hath
conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the
captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. 
\v 17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they
besieged Tirzah. 
\v 18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he
went into the palace of the king’s house, and burnt the king’s house over him
with fire, and died, 
\v 19 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in
walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to
sin. 
\v 20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, 
\add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel?
\p
\v 21 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the
people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed
Omri. 
\v 22 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that
followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
\p
\v 23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign
over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah. 
\v 24 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and
built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the
name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
\p
\v 25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all
that \add were\add* before him. 
\v 26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his
sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to
anger with their vanities. 
\v 27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he
shewed, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel? 
\v 28 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his
son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the
son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel
in Samaria twenty and two years. 
\v 30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all
that \add were\add* before him. 
\v 31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in
the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the
daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and
worshipped him. 
\v 32 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had
built in Samaria. 
\v 33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of
Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
\p
\v 34 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation
thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest
\add son\add* Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
Joshua the son of Nun.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 And Elijah the Tishbite, \add who was\add* of the inhabitants of Gilead,
said unto Ahab, \add As\add* the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I
stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
\v 2 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
\v 3 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook
Cherith, that \add is\add* before Jordan. 
\v 4 And it shall be, \add that\add* thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have
commanded the ravens to feed thee there. 
\v 5 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he went and
dwelt by the brook Cherith, that \add is\add* before Jordan. 
\v 6 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and
flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook. 
\v 7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there
had been no rain in the land.
\p
\v 8 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
\v 9 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which \add belongeth\add* to Zidon, and
dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee. 
\v 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the
city, behold, the widow woman \add was\add* there gathering of sticks: and he
called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel,
that I may drink. 
\v 11 And as she was going to fetch \add it,\add* he called to her, and said,
Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand. 
\v 12 And she said, \add As\add* the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake,
but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold,
I \add am\add* gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and
my son, that we may eat it, and die. 
\v 13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go \add and\add* do as thou hast
said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring \add it\add* unto me,
and after make for thee and for thy son. 
\v 14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not
waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day \add that
\add* the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth. 
\v 15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she, and he,
and her house, did eat \add many\add* days. 
\v 16 \add And\add* the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of
oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass after these things, \add that\add* the son of the
woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore,
that there was no breath left in him. 
\v 18 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of
God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son?
\v 19 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom,
and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and laid him upon his own
bed. 
\v 20 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou also
brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 
\v 21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto the
LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into
him again. 
\v 22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the child came
into him again, and he revived. 
\v 23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into
the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijah said, See, thy son
liveth.
\p
\v 24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou \add art
\add* a man of God, \add and\add* that the word of the LORD in thy mouth 
\add is\add* truth.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass \add after\add* many days, that the word of the LORD
came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I
will send rain upon the earth. 
\v 2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And \add there was\add* a sore
famine in Samaria. 
\v 3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which \add was\add* the governor of \add his
\add* house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: 
\v 4 For it was \add so,\add* when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and
fed them with bread and water.) 
\v 5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of
water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses
and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts. 
\v 6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went
one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
\p
\v 7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him,
and fell on his face, and said, \add Art\add* thou that my lord Elijah? 
\v 8 And he answered him, I \add am:\add* go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah 
\add is here. \add*
\v 9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant
into the hand of Ahab, to slay me? 
\v 10 \add As\add* the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,
whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, \add He is
\add* not \add there;\add* he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that
they found thee not. 
\v 11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah \add is here. 
\add*
\v 12 And it shall come to pass, \add as soon as\add* I am gone from thee,
that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I
come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy
servant fear the LORD from my youth. 
\v 13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the
LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’S prophets by fifty in a cave, and
fed them with bread and water? 
\v 14 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah \add is here:
\add* and he shall slay me. 
\v 15 And Elijah said, \add As\add* the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day. 
\v 16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet
Elijah.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, 
\add Art\add* thou he that troubleth Israel? 
\v 18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father’s
house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast
followed Baalim. 
\v 19 Now therefore send, \add and\add* gather to me all Israel unto mount
Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of
the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table. 
\v 20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets
together unto mount Carmel. 
\v 21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between
two opinions? if the LORD \add be\add* God, follow him: but if Baal, 
\add then\add* follow him. And the people answered him not a word. 
\v 22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, \add even\add* I only, remain a
prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets \add are\add* four hundred and fifty
men. 
\v 23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock
for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay \add it\add* on wood, and put no
fire \add under:\add* and I will dress the other bullock, and lay \add it
\add* on wood, and put no fire \add under: \add*
\v 24 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the
LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people
answered and said, It is well spoken. 
\v 25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for
yourselves, and dress \add it\add* first; for ye \add are\add* many; and call
on the name of your gods, but put no fire \add under. \add*
\v 26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed 
\add it,\add* and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,
saying, O Baal, hear us. But \add there was\add* no voice, nor any that
answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made. 
\v 27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry
aloud: for he \add is\add* a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or
he is in a journey, \add or\add* peradventure he sleepeth, and must be
awaked. 
\v 28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives
and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them. 
\v 29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the
\add time\add* of the offering of the \add evening\add* sacrifice, that 
\add there was\add* neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded. 
\v 30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the
people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD \add that
was\add* broken down. 
\v 31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of
the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall
be thy name: 
\v 32 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he
made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of
seed. 
\v 33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid 
\add him\add* on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour 
\add it\add* on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood. 
\v 34 And he said, Do \add it\add* the second time. And they did \add it
\add* the second time. And he said, Do \add it\add* the third time. And they
did \add it\add* the third time. 
\v 35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the trench also
with water. 
\v 36 And it came to pass at \add the time of\add* the offering of the 
\add evening\add* sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD
God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art
God in Israel, and \add that\add* I \add am\add* thy servant, and \add that
\add* I have done all these things at thy word. 
\v 37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou 
\add art\add* the LORD God, and \add that\add* thou hast turned their heart
back again. 
\v 38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and
the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the water that 
\add was\add* in the trench. 
\v 39 And when all the people saw \add it,\add* they fell on their faces: and
they said, The LORD, he \add is\add* the God; the LORD, he \add is\add* the
God. 
\v 40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not one of
them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to the brook
Kishon, and slew them there.
\p
\v 41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for \add there
is\add* a sound of abundance of rain. 
\v 42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of
Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face between his
knees, 
\v 43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up,
and looked, and said, \add There is\add* nothing. And he said, Go again seven
times. 
\v 44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there
ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he said, Go up,
say unto Ahab, Prepare \add thy chariot,\add* and get thee down, that the rain
stop thee not. 
\v 45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was black with
clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, and went to
Jezreel. 
\v 46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his loins, and
ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how he had
slain all the prophets with the sword. 
\v 2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do 
\add to me,\add* and more also, if I make not thy life as the life of one of
them by to morrow about this time. 
\v 3 And when he saw \add that,\add* he arose, and went for his life, and came
to Beer-sheba, which \add belongeth\add* to Judah, and left his servant
there.
\p
\v 4 But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness, and came and sat
down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself that he might die; and
said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life; for I \add am\add* not
better than my fathers. 
\v 5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel
touched him, and said unto him, Arise \add and\add* eat. 
\v 6 And he looked, and, behold, \add there was\add* a cake baken on the
coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laid
him down again. 
\v 7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touched him,
and said, Arise \add and\add* eat; because the journey \add is\add* too great
for thee. 
\v 8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength of that
meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
\p
\v 9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold, the word
of the LORD \add came\add* to him, and he said unto him, What doest thou here,
Elijah? 
\v 10 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the
children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars, and
slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, \add even\add* I only, am left; and
they seek my life, to take it away. 
\v 11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD. And,
behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains,
and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; \add but\add* the LORD 
\add was\add* not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; \add but
\add* the LORD \add was\add* not in the earthquake: 
\v 12 And after the earthquake a fire; \add but\add* the LORD \add was
\add* not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice. 
\v 13 And it was \add so,\add* when Elijah heard \add it,\add* that he wrapped
his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the
cave. And, behold, \add there came\add* a voice unto him, and said, What doest
thou here, Elijah? 
\v 14 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because
the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thine altars,
and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, \add even\add* I only, am left;
and they seek my life, to take it away. 
\v 15 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of
Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael \add to be\add* king over
Syria: 
\v 16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint \add to be\add* king over
Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah shalt thou anoint 
\add to be\add* prophet in thy room. 
\v 17 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* him that escapeth the sword of
Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehu shall
Elisha slay. 
\v 18 Yet I have left \add me\add* seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
\p
\v 19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who 
\add was\add* plowing \add with\add* twelve yoke \add of oxen\add* before him,
and he with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon
him. 
\v 20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, I pray
thee, kiss my father and my mother, and \add then\add* I will follow thee. And
he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee? 
\v 21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slew them,
and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, and gave unto the
people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered
unto him.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 And Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and 
\add there were\add* thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots:
and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it. 
\v 2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, and said
unto him, Thus saith Ben-hadad, 
\v 3 Thy silver and thy gold \add is\add* mine; thy wives also and thy
children, \add even\add* the goodliest, \add are\add* mine. 
\v 4 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to
thy saying, I \add am\add* thine, and all that I have. 
\v 5 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Ben-hadad, saying,
Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver, and
thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 
\v 6 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and they
shall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shall be, 
\add that\add* whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put 
\add it\add* in their hand, and take \add it\add* away. 
\v 7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and said,
Mark, I pray you, and see how this \add man\add* seeketh mischief: for he sent
unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, and for my gold;
and I denied him not. 
\v 8 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not 
\add unto him,\add* nor consent. 
\v 9 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the
king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first I will do: but
this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, and brought him word
again. 
\v 10 And Ben-hadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me, and more
also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people
that follow me. 
\v 11 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell \add him,\add* Let not
him that girdeth on \add his harness\add* boast himself as he that putteth it
off. 
\v 12 And it came to pass, when \add Ben-hadad\add* heard this message, as he
\add was\add* drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions,that he said unto
his servants, Set \add yourselves in array.\add* And they set \add themselves
in array\add* against the city.
\p
\v 13 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel, saying, Thus
saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude? behold, I will
deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shalt know that I \add am
\add* the LORD. 
\v 14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, \add Even
\add* by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Who
shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou. 
\v 15 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they
were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numbered all the people, 
\add even\add* all the children of Israel, \add being\add* seven thousand. 
\v 16 And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad \add was\add* drinking himself
drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped
him. 
\v 17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first; and
Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of
Samaria. 
\v 18 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them alive; or
whether they be come out for war, take them alive. 
\v 19 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city,
and the army which followed them. 
\v 20 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and Israel
pursued them: and Ben-hadad the king of Syria escaped on an horse with the
horsemen. 
\v 21 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and chariots, and
slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
\p
\v 22 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him, Go,
strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at the return of
the year the king of Syria will come up against thee. 
\v 23 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods 
\add are\add* gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but let
us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than
they. 
\v 24 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his place, and
put captains in their rooms: 
\v 25 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost, horse for
horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, 
\add and\add* surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto
their voice, and did so. 
\v 26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Ben-hadad numbered
the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel. 
\v 27 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present, and went
against them: and the children of Israel pitched before them like two little
flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country. 
\v 28 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel, and
said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORD \add is
\add* God of the hills, but he \add is\add* not God of the valleys, therefore
will I deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall know
that I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 29 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was,
that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the children of Israel slew
of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day. 
\v 30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and \add there\add* a wall
fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men \add that were\add* left. And
Ben-hadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
\p
\v 31 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings
of the house of Israel \add are\add* merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put
sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out to the king of
Israel: peradventure he will save thy life. 
\v 32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and \add put\add* ropes on
their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Ben-hadad
saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, \add Is\add* he yet alive? he is
my brother. 
\v 33 Now the men did diligently observe whether \add any thing would come
\add* from him, and did hastily catch \add it:\add* and they said, Thy brother
Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him;
and he caused him to come up into the chariot. 
\v 34 And \add Ben-hadad\add* said unto him, The cities, which my father took
from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for thee in
Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then \add said Ahab,\add* I will send
thee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him
away.
\p
\v 35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in
the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man refused to smite
him. 
\v 36 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the
LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shall slay thee.
And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slew him. 
\v 37 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man
smote him, so that in smiting he wounded \add him. \add*
\v 38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, and
disguised himself with ashes upon his face. 
\v 39 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said, Thy
servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned
aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: if by any means he
be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a
talent of silver. 
\v 40 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of
Israel said unto him, So \add shall\add* thy judgment \add be;\add* thyself
hast decided \add it. \add*
\v 41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the king of
Israel discerned him that he \add was\add* of the prophets. 
\v 42 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast let go out
of \add thy\add* hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction, therefore
thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for his people. 
\v 43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased, and came
to Samaria.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after these things, \add that\add* Naboth the
Jezreelite had a vineyard, which \add was\add* in Jezreel, hard by the palace
of Ahab king of Samaria. 
\v 2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that I may have
it for a garden of herbs, because it \add is\add* near unto my house: and I
will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; \add or,\add* if it seem good
to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money. 
\v 3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the
inheritance of my fathers unto thee. 
\v 4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word
which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not
give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed,
and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
\p
\v 5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so
sad, that thou eatest no bread? 
\v 6 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and
said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I
will give thee \add another\add* vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not
give thee my vineyard. 
\v 7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of
Israel? arise, \add and\add* eat bread, and let thine heart be merry: I will
give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
\v 8 So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed \add them\add* with his
seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that \add were
\add* in his city, dwelling with Naboth. 
\v 9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on
high among the people: 
\v 10 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against
him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And \add then\add* carry
him out, and stone him, that he may die. 
\v 11 And the men of his city, \add even\add* the elders and the nobles who
were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, 
\add and\add* as it \add was\add* written in the letters which she had sent
unto them. 
\v 12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people. 
\v 13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and
the men of Belial witnessed against him, \add even\add* against Naboth, in the
presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then
they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he
died. 
\v 14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
\p
\v 15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was
dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of
Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is
not alive, but dead. 
\v 16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab
rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take
possession of it.
\p
\v 17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
\v 18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which \add is\add* in
Samaria: behold, \add he is\add* in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone
down to possess it. 
\v 19 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou
killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus
saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs
lick thy blood, even thine. 
\v 20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And he
answered, I have found \add thee:\add* because thou hast sold thyself to work
evil in the sight of the LORD. 
\v 21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy posterity,
and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is
shut up and left in Israel, 
\v 22 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith
thou hast provoked \add me\add* to anger, and made Israel to sin. 
\v 23 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel
by the wall of Jezreel. 
\v 24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that
dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
\p
\v 25 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work
wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up. 
\v 26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all 
\add things\add* as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the
children of Israel. 
\v 27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his
clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth,
and went softly. 
\v 28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, 
\v 29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he humbleth
himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: \add but\add* in his
son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel. 
\v 2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
came down to the king of Israel. 
\v 3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth in
Gilead \add is\add* ours, and we \add be\add* still, \add and\add* take it not
out of the hand of the king of Syria? 
\v 4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-
gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I \add am\add* as thou 
\add art,\add* my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses. 
\v 5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at
the word of the LORD to day. 
\v 6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four
hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle,
or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the Lord shall deliver 
\add it\add* into the hand of the king. 
\v 7 And Jehoshaphat said, \add Is there\add* not here a prophet of the LORD
besides, that we might enquire of him? 
\v 8 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, \add There is\add* yet one
man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate
him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat
said, Let not the king say so. 
\v 9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten \add hither
\add* Micaiah the son of Imlah. 
\v 10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his
throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in the entrance of the gate
of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them. 
\v 11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said,
Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until thou have
consumed them. 
\v 12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth- gilead, and
prosper: for the LORD shall deliver \add it\add* into the king’s hand. 
\v 13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him, saying,
Behold now, the words of the prophets \add declare\add* good unto the king
with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them,
and speak \add that which is\add* good. 
\v 14 And Micaiah said, \add As\add* the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto
me, that will I speak.
\p
\v 15 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go
against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go,
and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver \add it\add* into the hand of the
king. 
\v 16 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou
tell me nothing but \add that which is\add* true in the name of the LORD? 
\v 17 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that
have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return
every man to his house in peace. 
\v 18 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that
he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil? 
\v 19 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD
sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right
hand and on his left. 
\v 20 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up and fall
at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that
manner. 
\v 21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I
will persuade him. 
\v 22 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go forth, and
I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou
shalt persuade \add him,\add* and prevail also: go forth, and do so. 
\v 23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of
all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil concerning thee. 
\v 24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah on the
cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto
thee? 
\v 25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt go
into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
\v 26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon
the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son; 
\v 27 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this \add fellow\add* in the prison,
and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I
come in peace. 
\v 28 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hath not
spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you. 
\v 29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to
Ramoth-gilead. 
\v 30 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself,
and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel
disguised himself, and went into the battle. 
\v 31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had
rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only
with the king of Israel. 
\v 32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
that they said, Surely it \add is\add* the king of Israel. And they turned
aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out. 
\v 33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it
\add was\add* not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing
him. 
\v 34 And a \add certain\add* man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto the driver
of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am
wounded. 
\v 35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up in his
chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ran out of the
wound into the midst of the chariot. 
\v 36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down
of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his own country.
\p
\v 37 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried the king
in Samaria. 
\v 38 And \add one\add* washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the
dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto the word
of the LORD which he spake. 
\v 39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory
house which he made, and all the cities that he built, \add are\add* they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? 
\v 40 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in his
stead.
\p
\v 41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth
year of Ahab king of Israel. 
\v 42 Jehoshaphat \add was\add* thirty and five years old when he began to
reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s
name \add was\add* Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
\v 43 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not aside
from it, doing \add that which was\add* right in the eyes of the LORD:
nevertheless the high places were not taken away; \add for\add* the people
offered and burnt incense yet in the high places. 
\v 44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel. 
\v 45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he shewed,
and how he warred, \add are\add* they not written in the book of the
chronicles of the kings of Judah? 
\v 46 And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days of his
father Asa, he took out of the land. 
\v 47 \add There was\add* then no king in Edom: a deputy \add was\add* king. 
\v 48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: but they
went not; for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber. 
\v 49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go
with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
\p
\v 50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers
in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
\p
\v 51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the
seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned two years over
Israel. 
\v 52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his
father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 
\v 53 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD
God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.
