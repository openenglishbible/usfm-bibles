\p
\ms1 Book I 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Blessed \add is\add* the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the
scornful.
\q1
\v 2 But his delight \add is\add* in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth
he meditate day and night.
\q1
\v 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth
forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever
he doeth shall prosper.
\q1
\v 4 The ungodly \add are\add* not so: but \add are\add* like the chaff which
the wind driveth away.
\q1
\v 5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the
congregation of the righteous.
\q1
\v 6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly
shall perish.
\b
\q1
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
\b
\q1
\v 2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, \add saying,\add*
\q1
\v 3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
\q1
\v 4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in
derision.
\q1
\v 5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore
displeasure.
\q1
\v 6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
\q1
\v 7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou \add art
\add* my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
\q1
\v 8 Ask of me, and I shall give \add thee\add* the heathen \add for
\add* thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth \add for
\add* thy possession.
\q1
\v 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces
like a potter’s vessel.
\q1
\v 10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the
earth.
\q1
\v 11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
\q1
\v 12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish \add from\add* the way,
when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed \add are\add* all they that
put their trust in him.
\b
\q1
\c 3
\p
\d A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
\p
\v 1 LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many \add are\add* they
that rise up against me.
\q1
\v 2 Many \add there be\add* which say of my soul, \add There is\add* no help
for him in God. Selah.
\q1
\v 3 But thou, O LORD, \add art\add* a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter
up of mine head.
\q1
\v 4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy
hill. Selah.
\q1
\v 5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
\q1
\v 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set 
\add themselves\add* against me round about.
\q1
\v 7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies
\add upon\add* the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
\q1
\v 8 Salvation \add belongeth\add* unto the LORD: thy blessing \add is
\add* upon thy people. Selah.
\b
\q1
\c 4
\p
\d To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me 
\add when I was\add* in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
\q1
\v 2 O ye sons of men, how long \add will ye turn\add* my glory into shame? 
\add how long\add* will ye love vanity, \add and\add* seek after leasing?
Selah.
\q1
\v 3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the
LORD will hear when I call unto him.
\q1
\v 4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and
be still. Selah.
\q1
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.
\q1
\v 6 \add There be\add* many that say, Who will shew us \add any\add* good?
LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
\q1
\v 7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time \add that
\add* their corn and their wine increased.
\q1
\v 8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest
me dwell in safety.
\b
\q1
\c 5
\p
\d To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
\q1
\v 2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will
I pray.
\q1
\v 3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I
direct \add my prayer\add* unto thee, and will look up.
\q1
\v 4 For thou \add art\add* not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
neither shall evil dwell with thee.
\q1
\v 5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of
iniquity.
\q1
\v 6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the
bloody and deceitful man.
\q1
\v 7 But as for me, I will come \add into\add* thy house in the multitude of
thy mercy: \add and\add* in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
\q1
\v 8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy
way straight before my face.
\q1
\v 9 For \add there is\add* no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part
\add is\add* very wickedness; their throat \add is\add* an open sepulchre;
they flatter with their tongue.
\q1
\v 10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them
out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against
thee.
\q1
\v 11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever
shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name
be joyful in thee.
\q1
\v 12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass
him as \add with\add* a shield.
\b
\q1
\c 6
\p
\d To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot
displeasure.
\q1
\v 2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I \add am\add* weak: O LORD, heal me; for
my bones are vexed.
\q1
\v 3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
\q1
\v 4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.
\q1
\v 5 For in death \add there is\add* no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
shall give thee thanks?
\q1
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water
my couch with my tears.
\q1
\v 7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine
enemies.
\q1
\v 8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the
voice of my weeping.
\q1
\v 9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
\q1
\v 10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return 
\add and\add* be ashamed suddenly.
\b
\q1
\c 7
\p
\d Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of
Cush the Benjamite.
\p
\v 1 O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that
persecute me, and deliver me:
\q1
\v 2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending \add it\add* in pieces, while 
\add there is\add* none to deliver.
\q1
\v 3 O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
\q1
\v 4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have
delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
\q1
\v 5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take \add it;\add* yea, let him
tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
\q1
\v 6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of
mine enemies: and awake for me \add to\add* the judgment \add that\add* thou
hast commanded.
\q1
\v 7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their
sakes therefore return thou on high.
\q1
\v 8 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my
righteousness, and according to mine integrity \add that is\add* in me.
\q1
\v 9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the
just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
\q1
\v 10 My defence \add is\add* of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
\q1
\v 11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry \add with the wicked
\add* every day.
\q1
\v 12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made
it ready.
\q1
\v 13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his
arrows against the persecutors.
\q1
\v 14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and
brought forth falsehood.
\q1
\v 15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch \add which
\add* he made.
\q1
\v 16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing
shall come down upon his own pate.
\q1
\v 17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing
praise to the name of the LORD most high.
\b
\q1
\c 8
\p
\d To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 O LORD our Lord, how excellent \add is\add* thy name in all the earth!
who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
\q1
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength
because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
\q1
\v 3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the
stars, which thou hast ordained;
\q1
\v 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou
visitest him?
\q1
\v 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned
him with glory and honour.
\q1
\v 6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast
put all \add things\add* under his feet:
\q1
\v 7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
\q1
\v 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, \add and whatsoever
\add* passeth through the paths of the seas.
\q1
\v 9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
\b
\q1
\c 9
\p
\d To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 I will praise \add thee,\add* O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew
forth all thy marvellous works.
\q1
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O
thou most High.
\q1
\v 3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy
presence.
\q1
\v 4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne
judging right.
\q1
\v 5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast
put out their name for ever and ever.
\q1
\v 6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast
destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
\q1
\v 7 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for
judgment.
\q1
\v 8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment
to the people in uprightness.
\q1
\v 9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of
trouble.
\q1
\v 10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou,
LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
\q1
\v 11 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the
people his doings.
\q1
\v 12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth
not the cry of the humble.
\q1
\v 13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble \add which I suffer
\add* of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
\q1
\v 14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of
Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
\q1
\v 15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit \add that\add* they made: in the
net which they hid is their own foot taken.
\q1
\v 16 The LORD is known \add by\add* the judgment \add which\add* he
executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.
Selah.
\q1
\v 17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, \add and\add* all the nations that
forget God.
\q1
\v 18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor
shall \add not\add* perish for ever.
\q1
\v 19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy
sight.
\q1
\v 20 Put them in fear, O LORD: \add that\add* the nations may know themselves
\add to be but\add* men. Selah.
\b
\q1
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? \add why\add* hidest thou \add thyself
\add* in times of trouble?
\q1
\v 2 The wicked in \add his\add* pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
taken in the devices that they have imagined.
\q1
\v 3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous,
\add whom\add* the LORD abhorreth.
\q1
\v 4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek 
\add after God:\add* God \add is\add* not in all his thoughts.
\q1
\v 5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments \add are\add* far above out
of his sight: \add as for\add* all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
\q1
\v 6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for \add I shall
\add* never \add be\add* in adversity.
\q1
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue 
\add is\add* mischief and vanity.
\q1
\v 8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places
doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
\q1
\v 9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch
the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
\q1
\v 10 He croucheth, \add and\add* humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
his strong ones.
\q1
\v 11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he
will never see \add it.\add*
\q1
\v 12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
\q1
\v 13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou
wilt not require \add it.\add*
\q1
\v 14 Thou hast seen \add it;\add* for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
requite \add it\add* with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee;
thou art the helper of the fatherless.
\q1
\v 15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil \add man:\add* seek out
his wickedness \add till\add* thou find none.
\q1
\v 16 The LORD \add is\add* King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished
out of his land.
\q1
\v 17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their
heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
\q1
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may
no more oppress.
\b
\q1
\c 11
\p
\d To the chief Musician, A \add Psalm\add* of David.
\p
\v 1 In the LORD put I my trust: How say ye to my soul, Flee \add as
\add* a bird to your mountain?
\q1
\v 2 For, lo, the wicked bend \add their\add* bow, they make ready their arrow
upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
\q1
\v 3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
\q1
\v 4 The LORD \add is\add* in his holy temple, the LORD’S throne \add is
\add* in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
\q1
\v 5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth
violence his soul hateth.
\q1
\v 6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible
tempest: \add this shall be\add* the portion of their cup.
\q1
\v 7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold
the upright.
\b
\q1
\c 12
\p
\d To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among
the children of men.
\q1
\v 2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: \add with\add* flattering
lips \add and\add* with a double heart do they speak.
\q1
\v 3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, \add and\add* the tongue that
speaketh proud things:
\q1
\v 4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips \add are
\add* our own: who \add is\add* lord over us?
\q1
\v 5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I
arise, saith the LORD; I will set \add him\add* in safety \add from him that
\add* puffeth at him.
\q1
\v 6 The words of the LORD \add are\add* pure words: \add as\add* silver tried
in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
\q1
\v 7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this
generation for ever.
\q1
\v 8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
\b
\q1
\c 13
\p
\d To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt thou hide
thy face from me?
\q1
\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, \add having\add* sorrow in my
heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
\q1
\v 3 Consider \add and\add* hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
sleep the \add sleep of\add* death;
\q1
\v 4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; \add and\add* those
that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
\q1
\v 5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
salvation.
\q1
\v 6 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
\b
\q1
\c 14
\p
\d To the chief Musician, A \add Psalm\add* of David.
\p
\v 1 The fool hath said in his heart, \add There is\add* no God. They are
corrupt, they have done abominable works, \add there is\add* none that doeth
good.
\q1
\v 2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if
there were any that did understand, \add and\add* seek God.
\q1
\v 3 They are all gone aside, they are \add all\add* together become filthy: 
\add there is\add* none that doeth good, no, not one.
\q1
\v 4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people 
\add as\add* they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
\q1
\v 5 There were they in great fear: for God \add is\add* in the generation of
the righteous.
\q1
\v 6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD \add is
\add* his refuge.
\q1
\v 7 Oh that the salvation of Israel \add were come\add* out of Zion! when the
LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, 
\add and\add* Israel shall be glad.
\b
\q1
\c 15
\p
\d A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy
hill?
\q1
\v 2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the
truth in his heart.
\q1
\v 3 \add He that\add* backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
\q1
\v 4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear
the LORD. \add He that\add* sweareth to \add his own\add* hurt, and changeth
not.
\q1
\v 5 \add He that\add* putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
against the innocent. He that doeth these \add things\add* shall never be
moved.
\b
\q1
\c 16
\p
\d Michtam of David.
\p
\v 1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
\q1
\v 2 \add O my soul,\add* thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou \add art
\add* my Lord: my goodness \add extendeth\add* not to thee;
\q1
\v 3 \add But\add* to the saints that \add are\add* in the earth, and 
\add to\add* the excellent, in whom \add is\add* all my delight.
\q1
\v 4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied \add that\add* hasten \add after
\add* another \add god:\add* their drink offerings of blood will I not offer,
nor take up their names into my lips.
\q1
\v 5 The LORD \add is\add* the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
maintainest my lot.
\q1
\v 6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant \add places;\add* yea, I have a
goodly heritage.
\q1
\v 7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct
me in the night seasons.
\q1
\v 8 I have set the LORD always before me: because \add he is\add* at my right
hand, I shall not be moved.
\q1
\v 9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall
rest in hope.
\q1
\v 10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine
Holy One to see corruption.
\q1
\v 11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence \add is\add* fulness
of joy; at thy right hand \add there are\add* pleasures for evermore.
\b
\q1
\c 17
\p
\d A Prayer of David.
\p
\v 1 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, 
\add that goeth\add* not out of feigned lips.
\q1
\v 2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the
things that are equal.
\q1
\v 3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited \add me\add* in the night;
thou hast tried me, \add and\add* shalt find nothing; I am purposed 
\add that\add* my mouth shall not transgress.
\q1
\v 4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept 
\add me from\add* the paths of the destroyer.
\q1
\v 5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, \add that\add* my footsteps slip not.
\q1
\v 6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear
unto me, \add and hear\add* my speech.
\q1
\v 7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand
them which put their trust \add in thee\add* from those that rise up 
\add against them.\add*
\q1
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
\q1
\v 9 From the wicked that oppress me, \add from\add* my deadly enemies, 
\add who\add* compass me about.
\q1
\v 10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak
proudly.
\q1
\v 11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing
down to the earth;
\q1
\v 12 Like as a lion \add that\add* is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
young lion lurking in secret places.
\q1
\v 13 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the
wicked, \add which is\add* thy sword:
\q1
\v 14 From men \add which are\add* thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, 
\add which have\add* their portion in \add this\add* life, and whose belly
thou fillest with thy hid \add treasure:\add* they are full of children, and
leave the rest of their \add substance\add* to their babes.
\q1
\v 15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
\b
\q1
\c 18
\p
\d To the chief Musician, A \add Psalm\add* of David, the servant of the LORD,
who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day \add that
\add* the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the
hand of Saul: And he said,
\p
\v 1 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
\q1
\v 2 The LORD \add is\add* my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God,
my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, 
\add and\add* my high tower.
\q1
\v 3 I will call upon the LORD, \add who is worthy\add* to be praised: so
shall I be saved from mine enemies.
\q1
\v 4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me
afraid.
\q1
\v 5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented
me.
\q1
\v 6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my
voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, \add even\add* into his
ears.

\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills
moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
\q1
\v 8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth
devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\q1
\v 9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness \add was
\add* under his feet.
\q1
\v 10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings
of the wind.
\q1
\v 11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him 
\add were\add* dark waters \add and\add* thick clouds of the skies.
\q1
\v 12 At the brightness \add that was\add* before him his thick clouds passed,
hail \add stones\add* and coals of fire.

hail \add stones\add* and coals of fire.
\q1
\v 14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out
lightnings, and discomfited them.
\q1
\v 15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world
were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy
nostrils.
\q1
\v 16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
\q1
\v 17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for
they were too strong for me.
\q1
\v 18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
\q1
\v 19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he
delighted in me.
\q1
\v 20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the
cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
\q1
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed
from my God.
\q1
\v 22 For all his judgments \add were\add* before me, and I did not put away
his statutes from me.
\q1
\v 23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
\q1
\v 24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness,
according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
\q1
\v 25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man
thou wilt shew thyself upright;
\q1
\v 26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou
wilt shew thyself froward.
\q1
\v 27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high
looks.
\q1
\v 28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my
darkness.
\q1
\v 29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over
a wall.
\q1
\v 30 \add As for\add* God, his way \add is\add* perfect: the word of the LORD
is tried: he \add is\add* a buckler to all those that trust in him.
\q1
\v 31 For who \add is\add* God save the LORD? or who \add is\add* a rock save
our God?
\q1
\v 32 \add It is\add* God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
perfect.
\q1
\v 33 He maketh my feet like hinds’ \add feet,\add* and setteth me upon my
high places.
\q1
\v 34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine
arms.
\q1
\v 35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand
hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
\q1
\v 36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
\q1
\v 37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn
again till they were consumed.
\q1
\v 38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen
under my feet.
\q1
\v 39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued
under me those that rose up against me.
\q1
\v 40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy
them that hate me.
\q1
\v 41 They cried, but \add there was\add* none to save \add them: even
\add* unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
\q1
\v 42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them
out as the dirt in the streets.
\q1
\v 43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; \add and
\add* thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people \add whom
\add* I have not known shall serve me.
\q1
\v 44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall
submit themselves unto me.
\q1
\v 45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
\q1

\q1

\v 10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
\q1
\v 11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my
sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

\v 12 To the end that \add my\add* glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

\v 1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me
in thy righteousness.
\q1
\v 2 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock,
for an house of defence to save me.
\q1
\v 3 For thou \add art\add* my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name’s
sake lead me, and guide me.
\q1
\v 4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou 
\add art\add* my strength.
\q1
\v 5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of
truth.
\q1
\v 6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.
\q1
\v 7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my
trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
\q1
\v 8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet
in a large room.
\q1
\v 9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed
with grief, \add yea,\add* my soul and my belly.
\q1
\v 10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength
faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
\q1
\v 11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my
neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled
from me.
\q1
\v 12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.
\q1
\v 13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear \add was\add* on every side:
while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my
life.
\q1
\v 14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou \add art\add* my God.
\q1
\v 15 My times \add are\add* in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
enemies, and from them that persecute me.
\q1
\v 16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies’ sake.
\q1
\v 17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the
wicked be ashamed, \add and\add* let them be silent in the grave.
\q1
\v 18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things
proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
\q1
\v 19 \add Oh\add* how great \add is\add* thy goodness, which thou hast laid
up for them that fear thee; \add which\add* thou hast wrought for them that
trust in thee before the sons of men!
\q1
\v 20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of
man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
\q1
\v 21 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
kindness in a strong city.
\q1
\v 22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto
thee.
\q1
\v 23 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: \add for\add* the LORD preserveth
the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

\q1
\v 2 Blessed \add is\add* the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,

\q1
\v 3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day
long.
\q1
\v 4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into
the drought of summer. Selah.
\q1
\v 5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the
iniquity of my sin. Selah.
\q1
\v 6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou
mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh
unto him.
\q1
\v 7 Thou \add art\add* my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
\q1
\v 8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I
will guide thee with mine eye.
\q1
\v 9 Be ye not as the horse, \add or\add* as the mule, \add which\add* have no

\q1
\v 10 Many sorrows \add shall be\add* to the wicked: but he that trusteth in

\q1
\v 3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
\q1
\v 4 For the word of the LORD \add is\add* right; and all his works 
\add are done\add* in truth.
\q1
\v 5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness
of the LORD.
\q1
\v 6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them
by the breath of his mouth.
\q1
\v 7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the
depth in storehouses.
\q1
\v 8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world
stand in awe of him.
\q1
\v 9 For he spake, and it was \add done;\add* he commanded, and it stood
fast.
\q1
\v 10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the
devices of the people of none effect.
\q1
\v 11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to

\q1
\v 12 Blessed \add is\add* the nation whose God \add is\add* the LORD:

\q1

\q1
\v 14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of
the earth.
\q1
\v 15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
\q1
\v 16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not

\q1
\v 18 Behold, the eye of the LORD \add is\add* upon them that fear him, upon

\q1
\v 6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORD

\q1
\v 10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who \add is\add* like unto thee, which

\q1
\v 12 They rewarded me evil for good \add to\add* the spoiling of my soul.

\q1
\v 3 The words of his mouth \add are\add* iniquity and deceit: he hath left
off to be wise, \add and\add* to do good.
\q1
\v 4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way

faithfulness \add reacheth\add* unto the clouds.
\q1
\v 6 Thy righteousness \add is\add* like the great mountains; thy judgments

\v 7 How excellent \add is\add* thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
\q1
\v 8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and

\q1
\v 8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do

\q1
\v 6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened:
burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.

\q1
\v 9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not
refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
\q1
\v 10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy
faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and
thy truth from the great congregation.
\q1
\v 11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
\q1
\v 12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have
taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the
hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
\q1
\v 13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
\q1
\v 14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to
destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
\q1
\v 15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha,
aha.
\q1
\v 16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as
love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
\q1

\q1
\v 2 \add How\add* thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and
plantedst them; \add how\add* thou didst afflict the people, and cast them
out.
\q1
\v 3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did
their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of
thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
\q1
\v 4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
\q1
\v 5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we
tread them under that rise up against us.
\q1
\v 6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
\q1
\v 7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that
hated us.

\q1
\v 9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our
armies.
\q1
\v 10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil
for themselves.
\q1
\v 11 Thou hast given us like sheep \add appointed\add* for meat; and hast
scattered us among the heathen.
\q1
\v 12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase \add thy
wealth\add* by their price.
\q1
\v 13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to
them that are round about us.
\q1
\v 14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among
the people.
\q1
\v 15 My confusion \add is\add* continually before me, and the shame of my
face hath covered me,

\v 16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the
enemy and avenger.
\q1
\v 17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have
we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
\q1
\v 18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy
way;

\v 19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us
with the shadow of death.
\q1
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to
a strange god;
\q1
\v 21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
\q1
\v 22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as
sheep for the slaughter.

\q1
\v 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, \add and\add* forgettest our affliction

\d To the chief Musician upon Mahalath, Maschil, A \add Psalm\add* of David.
\p
\v 1 The fool hath said in his heart, \add There is\add* no God. Corrupt are
they, and have done abominable iniquity: \add there is\add* none that doeth
good.
\q1
\v 2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there
were \add any\add* that did understand, that did seek God.
\q1
\v 3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; 
\add there is\add* none that doeth good, no, not one.
\q1
\v 4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people 
\add as\add* they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
\q1
\v 5 There were they in great fear, \add where\add* no fear was: for God hath
scattered the bones of him that encampeth \add against\add* thee: thou hast
put \add them\add* to shame, because God hath despised them.
\q1
\v 6 Oh that the salvation of Israel \add were come\add* out of Zion! When God
bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, \add and
\add* Israel shall be glad.

\p
\d To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A \add Psalm\add* of David,

\p
\v 1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
\q1
\v 2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
\q1
\v 3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul:
they have not set God before them. Selah.
\q1
\v 4 Behold, God \add is\add* mine helper: the Lord \add is\add* with them
that uphold my soul.
\q1
\v 5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
\q1
\v 6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for 
\add it is\add* good.
\q1
\v 7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen 
\add his desire\add* upon mine enemies.
\b
\q1
\c 55
\p
\d To the chief Musician on Neginoth, Maschil, A \add Psalm\add* of David.
\p
\v 1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
\q1
\v 2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
\q1
\v 3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the
wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
\q1
\v 4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen
upon me.
\q1
\v 5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed
me.
\q1
\v 6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! \add for then\add* would I
fly away, and be at rest.
\q1
\v 7 Lo, \add then\add* would I wander far off, \add and\add* remain in the
wilderness. Selah.
\q1
\v 8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm \add and\add* tempest.
\q1
\v 9 Destroy, O Lord, \add and\add* divide their tongues: for I have seen
violence and strife in the city.
\q1
\v 10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and
sorrow \add are\add* in the midst of it.
\q1
\v 11 Wickedness \add is\add* in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart
not from her streets.
\q1
\v 12 For \add it was\add* not an enemy \add that\add* reproached me; then I
could have borne \add it:\add* neither \add was it\add* he that hated me 
\add that\add* did magnify \add himself\add* against me; then I would have hid
myself from him:
\q1
\v 13 But \add it was\add* thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
acquaintance.
\q1
\v 14 We took sweet counsel together, \add and\add* walked unto the house of
God in company.
\q1
\v 15 Let death seize upon them, \add and\add* let them go down quick into
hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, \add and\add* among them.
\q1
\v 16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
\q1
\v 17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he
shall hear my voice.
\q1
\v 18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle \add that was
\add* against me: for there were many with me.
\q1
\v 19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah.
Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
\q1
\v 20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he
hath broken his covenant.
\q1
\v 21 \add The words\add* of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war 
\add was\add* in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet \add were
\add* they drawn swords.
\q1
\v 22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never
suffer the righteous to be moved.
\q1
\v 23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust
in thee.

\q1
\v 2 Mine enemies would daily swallow \add me\add* up: for \add they be

\q1
\v 3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
\q1
\v 4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not
fear what flesh can do unto me.
\q1
\v 5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts \add are\add* against
me for evil.
\q1
\v 6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my
steps, when they wait for my soul.
\q1
\v 7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in \add thine\add* anger cast down the
people, O God.
\q1
\v 8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: 
\add are they\add* not in thy book?
\q1
\v 9 When I cry \add unto thee,\add* then shall mine enemies turn back: this I
know; for God \add is\add* for me.
\q1
\v 10 In God will I praise \add his\add* word: in the LORD will I praise 
\add his\add* word.
\q1
\v 11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto
me.
\q1
\v 12 Thy vows \add are\add* upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
\q1
\v 13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: \add wilt\add* not 
\add thou deliver\add* my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the
light of the living?

\c 57
\p
\d To the chief Musician, Altaschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul

\q1
\v 2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth \add all things
\add* for me.
\q1
\v 3 He shall send from heaven, and save \add from\add* the reproach of him
that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his

\q1
\v 4 My soul \add is\add* among lions: \add and\add* I lie \add even among

\q1
\v 5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; \add let\add* thy glory

\q1
\v 6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have

\add* Selah.
\q1
\v 7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give
praise.

\p
\v 1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly,
O ye sons of men?
\q1
\v 2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in
the earth.
\q1
\v 3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be

\q1
\v 4 Their poison \add is\add* like the poison of a serpent: \add they are

\v 5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so

\q1
\v 6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of

\q1
\v 7 Let them melt away as waters \add which\add* run continually: \add when

\v 6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about

\q1
\v 12 \add For\add* the sin of their mouth \add and\add* the words of their

\p
\v 1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been

\q1
\v 2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the

\q1
\v 2 I sink in deep mire, where \add there is\add* no standing: I am come into
deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
\q1
\v 3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait
for my God.
\q1
\v 4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head:
they that would destroy me, \add being\add* mine enemies wrongfully, are
mighty: then I restored \add that\add* which I took not away.
\q1
\v 5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
\q1
\v 6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my
sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of
Israel.
\q1
\v 7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
\q1
\v 8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother’s
children.
\q1
\v 9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them
that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
\q1
\v 10 When I wept, \add and chastened\add* my soul with fasting, that was to
my reproach.
\q1
\v 11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to them.
\q1
\v 12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I \add was\add* the song
of the drunkards.
\q1
\v 13 But as for me, my prayer \add is\add* unto thee, O LORD, \add in
\add* an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the
truth of thy salvation.
\q1
\v 14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered
from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
\q1
\v 15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up,
and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
\q1
\v 16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness \add is\add* good: turn unto me
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
\q1
\v 17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me
speedily.
\q1
\v 18 Draw nigh unto my soul, \add and\add* redeem it: deliver me because of
mine enemies.
\q1
\v 19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine
adversaries \add are\add* all before thee.
\q1
\v 20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked
\add for some\add* to take pity, but \add there was\add* none; and for
comforters, but I found none.
\q1
\v 21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me
vinegar to drink.
\q1
\v 22 Let their table become a snare before them: and \add that which should
have been\add* for \add their\add* welfare, \add let it become\add* a trap.
\q1
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins
continually to shake.
\q1
\v 24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take
hold of them.
\q1
\v 25 Let their habitation be desolate; \add and\add* let none dwell in their
tents.
\q1
\v 26 For they persecute \add him\add* whom thou hast smitten; and they talk
to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
\q1
\v 27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy
righteousness.
\q1
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written
with the righteous.
\q1
\v 29 But I \add am\add* poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me
up on high.
\q1
\v 30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with
thanksgiving.
\q1
\v 31 \add This\add* also shall please the LORD better than an ox \add or
\add* bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
\q1
\v 32 The humble shall see \add this, and\add* be glad: and your heart shall
live that seek God.
\q1
\v 33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
\q1
\v 34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that
moveth therein.
\q1
\v 35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they
may dwell there, and have it in possession.

\v 3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
\q1
\v 4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as
love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.

hast given commandment to save me; for thou \add art\add* my rock and my
fortress.
\q1
\v 4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of
the unrighteous and cruel man.
\q1
\v 5 For thou \add art\add* my hope, O Lord GOD: \add thou art\add* my trust

\q1
\v 6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out

\v 7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou \add art\add* my strong refuge.
\q1

\q1
\v 9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength
faileth.
\q1
\v 10 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul
take counsel together,

\q1
\v 12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

\v 13 Let them be confounded \add and\add* consumed that are adversaries to my

hurt.
\q1
\v 14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
\q1
\v 15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness \add and\add* thy salvation
all the day; for I know not the numbers \add thereof.\add*
\q1
\v 16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy

\q1
\v 17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared

\q1
\v 18 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I

\q1
\v 2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.

\q1
\v 4 For \add there are\add* no bands in their death: but their strength 
\add is\add* firm.
\q1
\v 5 They \add are\add* not in trouble \add as other\add* men; neither are
they plagued like \add other\add* men.
\q1
\v 6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them
\add as\add* a garment.
\q1
\v 7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
\q1
\v 8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly \add concerning\add* oppression:
they speak loftily.
\q1
\v 9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh
through the earth.
\q1
\v 10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full \add cup
\add* are wrung out to them.
\q1
\v 11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most

\v 12 Behold, these \add are\add* the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they

\q1
\v 14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
\q1
\v 15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend \add against

\q1
\v 14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, \add and\add* gavest him

\v 4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
\q1
\v 5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
\q1
\v 6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own
heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
\q1
\v 7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
\q1
\v 8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth \add his\add* promise fail for
evermore?
\q1
\v 9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender
mercies? Selah.
\q1
\v 10 And I said, This \add is\add* my infirmity: \add but I will remember
\add* the years of the right hand of the most High.
\q1
\v 11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy
wonders of old.
\q1
\v 12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
\q1
\v 13 Thy way, O God, \add is\add* in the sanctuary: who \add is so
\add* great a God as \add our\add* God?
\q1
\v 14 Thou \add art\add* the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
strength among the people.
\q1
\v 15 Thou hast with \add thine\add* arm redeemed thy people, the sons of
Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
\q1
\v 16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the
depths also were troubled.
\q1
\v 17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows
also went abroad.
\q1
\v 18 The voice of thy thunder \add was\add* in the heaven: the lightnings
lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
\q1
\v 19 Thy way \add is\add* in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and
thy footsteps are not known.
\q1
\v 20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

\p
\v 1 Give ear, O my people, \add to\add* my law: incline your ears to the
words of my mouth.
\q1
\v 2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
\q1
\v 3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
\q1
\v 4 We will not hide \add them\add* from their children, shewing to the
generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his
wonderful works that he hath done.
\q1
\v 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel,
which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their
children:
\q1
\v 6 That the generation to come might know \add them, even\add* the children
\add which\add* should be born; \add who\add* should arise and declare 
\add them\add* to their children:
\q1
\v 7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God,
but keep his commandments:
\q1
\v 8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation;
a generation \add that\add* set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was
not stedfast with God.
\q1
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, \add being\add* armed, \add and\add* carrying
bows, turned back in the day of battle.
\q1
\v 10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
\q1
\v 11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
\q1
\v 12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of
Egypt, \add in\add* the field of Zoan.
\q1
\v 13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the
waters to stand as an heap.
\q1
\v 14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a
light of fire.
\q1
\v 15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave \add them\add* drink as 
\add out of\add* the great depths.
\q1
\v 16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down
like rivers.
\q1
\v 17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the
wilderness.
\q1
\v 18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
\q1
\v 19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the
wilderness?
\q1
\v 20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams
overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
\q1
\v 21 Therefore the LORD heard \add this,\add* and was wroth: so a fire was
kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
\q1
\v 22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
\q1
\v 23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of
heaven,
\q1
\v 24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the
corn of heaven.
\q1
\v 25 Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.
\q1
\v 26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he
brought in the south wind.
\q1
\v 27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the
sand of the sea:
\q1
\v 28 And he let \add it\add* fall in the midst of their camp, round about
their habitations.
\q1
\v 29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own
desire;
\q1
\v 30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat 
\add was\add* yet in their mouths,
\q1
\v 31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote
down the chosen \add men\add* of Israel.
\q1
\v 32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous
works.
\q1
\v 33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in
trouble.
\q1
\v 34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired
early after God.
\q1
\v 35 And they remembered that God \add was\add* their rock, and the high God
their redeemer.
\q1
\v 36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto
him with their tongues.
\q1
\v 37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in
his covenant.
\q1
\v 38 But he, \add being\add* full of compassion, forgave \add their
\add* iniquity, and destroyed \add them\add* not: yea, many a time turned he
his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
\q1
\v 39 For he remembered that they \add were but\add* flesh; a wind that
passeth away, and cometh not again.
\q1
\v 40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, \add and\add* grieve him
in the desert!
\q1
\v 41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of
Israel.
\q1
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, \add nor\add* the day when he delivered
them from the enemy.
\q1
\v 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of
Zoan:
\q1
\v 44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they
could not drink.
\q1
\v 45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and
frogs, which destroyed them.
\q1
\v 46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto
the locust.
\q1
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with
frost.
\q1
\v 48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot
thunderbolts.
\q1
\v 49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation,
and trouble, by sending evil angels \add among them.\add*
\q1
\v 50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but
gave their life over to the pestilence;
\q1
\v 51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of \add their
\add* strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
\q1
\v 52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the
wilderness like a flock.
\q1
\v 53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea
overwhelmed their enemies.
\q1
\v 54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, \add even to
\add* this mountain, \add which\add* his right hand had purchased.
\q1
\v 55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\q1
\v 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his
testimonies:
\q1
\v 57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were
turned aside like a deceitful bow.
\q1
\v 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to
jealousy with their graven images.
\q1
\v 59 When God heard \add this,\add* he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
Israel:
\q1
\v 60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent \add which
\add* he placed among men;
\q1
\v 61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the
enemy’s hand.
\q1
\v 62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his
inheritance.
\q1
\v 63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to
marriage.
\q1
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
\q1
\v 65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, \add and\add* like a mighty
man that shouteth by reason of wine.
\q1
\v 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual
reproach.
\q1
\v 67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of
Ephraim:
\q1
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
\q1
\v 69 And he built his sanctuary like high \add palaces,\add* like the earth
which he hath established for ever.
\q1
\v 70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
\q1
\v 71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob
his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\q1
\v 72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them
by the skilfulness of his hands.

\p
\v 1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have
they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
\q1
\v 2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given \add to be\add* meat unto
the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the
earth.
\q1
\v 3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and 
\add there was\add* none to bury \add them.\add*
\q1
\v 4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them
that are round about us.
\q1
\v 5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousy burn like
fire?
\q1
\v 6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, and upon
the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
\q1
\v 7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
\q1
\v 8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender mercies
speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
\q1
\v 9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: and deliver
us, and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.
\q1
\v 10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where \add is\add* their God? let him
be known among the heathen in our sight \add by\add* the revenging of the
blood of thy servants \add which is\add* shed.
\q1
\v 11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to the
greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die;
\q1
\v 12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their
reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
\q1

\q1
\v 5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink

\q1
\v 6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among
themselves.
\q1
\v 7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall

\q1
\v 8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen,

\q1
\v 9 Thou preparedst \add room\add* before it, and didst cause it to take deep
root, and it filled the land.
\q1
\v 10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof 
\add were like\add* the goodly cedars.
\q1
\v 11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
\q1
\v 12 Why hast thou \add then\add* broken down her hedges, so that all they
which pass by the way do pluck her?
\q1
\v 13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field
doth devour it.
\q1

\add* I understood not.
\q1
\v 6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the
pots.
\q1
\v 7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the
secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
\q1
\v 8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt
hearken unto me;
\q1
\v 9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any
strange god.
\q1
\v 10 I \add am\add* the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
\q1
\v 11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of

\v 13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, \add and\add* Israel had walked

\q1
\v 14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against

Mahalath Leannoth, Maschil of Heman the Ezrahite.
\p
\v 1 O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day \add and\add* night before
thee:
\q1
\v 2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
\q1
\v 3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the
grave.
\q1
\v 4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man 
\add that hath\add* no strength:
\q1
\v 5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou
rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
\q1
\v 6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
\q1
\v 7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted \add me\add* with
all thy waves. Selah.
\q1
\v 8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an
abomination unto them: \add I am\add* shut up, and I cannot come forth.
\q1
\v 9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon
thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
\q1
\v 10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise \add and
\add* praise thee? Selah.
\q1
\v 11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? \add or\add* thy
faithfulness in destruction?
\q1
\v 12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the
land of forgetfulness?
\q1
\v 13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer
prevent thee.
\q1
\v 14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? \add why\add* hidest thou thy face
from me?
\q1
\v 15 I \add am\add* afflicted and ready to die from \add my\add* youth up: 
\add while\add* I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
\q1
\v 16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
\q1
\v 17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about
together.
\q1
\v 18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, \add and\add* mine
acquaintance into darkness.

\p
\d Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite.
\p
\v 1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I
make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
\q1
\v 2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt
thou establish in the very heavens.
\q1
\v 3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my
servant,
\q1
\v 4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all
generations. Selah.
\q1
\v 5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also
in the congregation of the saints.
\q1
\v 6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? \add who\add* among
the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
\q1
\v 7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had
in reverence of all \add them that are\add* about him.
\q1
\v 8 O LORD God of hosts, who \add is\add* a strong LORD like unto thee? or to
thy faithfulness round about thee?
\q1
\v 9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou
stillest them.
\q1
\v 10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast
scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
\q1
\v 11 The heavens \add are\add* thine, the earth also \add is\add* thine: 
\add as for\add* the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
\q1
\v 12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall
rejoice in thy name.
\q1
\v 13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, \add and\add* high is thy
right hand.
\q1
\v 14 Justice and judgment \add are\add* the habitation of thy throne: mercy
and truth shall go before thy face.
\q1
\v 15 Blessed \add is\add* the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
\q1
\v 16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness
shall they be exalted.
\q1
\v 17 For thou \add art\add* the glory of their strength: and in thy favour
our horn shall be exalted.
\q1
\v 18 For the LORD \add is\add* our defence; and the Holy One of Israel 
\add is\add* our king.
\q1
\v 19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid
help upon \add one that is\add* mighty; I have exalted \add one\add* chosen
out of the people.
\q1
\v 20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
\q1
\v 21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen
him.
\q1
\v 22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict
him.
\q1
\v 23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate
him.
\q1
\v 24 But my faithfulness and my mercy \add shall be\add* with him: and in my
name shall his horn be exalted.
\q1
\v 25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
\q1
\v 26 He shall cry unto me, Thou \add art\add* my father, my God, and the rock
of my salvation.
\q1
\v 27 Also I will make him \add my\add* firstborn, higher than the kings of
the earth.
\q1
\v 28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand
fast with him.
\q1
\v 29 His seed also will I make \add to endure\add* for ever, and his throne
as the days of heaven.
\q1
\v 30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
\q1
\v 31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
\q1
\v 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity
with stripes.
\q1
\v 33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor
suffer my faithfulness to fail.
\q1
\v 34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my
lips.
\q1
\v 35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
\q1
\v 36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
\q1
\v 37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and \add as\add* a
faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
\q1
\v 38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine
anointed.
\q1
\v 39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his
crown \add by casting it\add* to the ground.
\q1
\v 40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds
to ruin.
\q1
\v 41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
\q1
\v 42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all
his enemies to rejoice.
\q1
\v 43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to
stand in the battle.
\q1
\v 44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the
ground.
\q1
\v 45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with
shame. Selah.
\q1
\v 46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn
like fire?
\q1
\v 47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in
vain?
\q1
\v 48 What man \add is he that\add* liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
\q1
\v 49 Lord, where \add are\add* thy former lovingkindnesses, \add which
\add* thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
\q1
\v 50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; \add how\add* I do bear in
my bosom \add the reproach of\add* all the mighty people;
\q1
\v 51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have
reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
\q1
\v 52 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

\p
\d A Prayer of Moses the man of God.
\p
\v 1 LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
\q1
\v 2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the
earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou \add art
\add* God.
\q1
\v 3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
\q1
\v 4 For a thousand years in thy sight \add are but\add* as yesterday when it
is past, and \add as\add* a watch in the night.
\q1
\v 5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are \add as\add* a sleep:
in the morning \add they are\add* like grass \add which\add* groweth up.
\q1
\v 6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut
down, and withereth.
\q1
\v 7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
\q1
\v 8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret \add sins
\add* in the light of thy countenance.
\q1
\v 9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a
tale \add that is told.\add*
\q1
\v 10 The days of our years \add are\add* threescore years and ten; and if by
reason of strength \add they be\add* fourscore years, yet \add is\add* their
strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
\q1
\v 11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, 
\add so is\add* thy wrath.
\q1
\v 12 So teach \add us\add* to number our days, that we may apply \add our
\add* hearts unto wisdom.
\q1
\v 13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy
servants.
\q1
\v 14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all
our days.
\q1
\v 15 Make us glad according to the days \add wherein\add* thou hast afflicted
us, \add and\add* the years \add wherein\add* we have seen evil.
\q1
\v 16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their
children.
\q1
\v 17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou
the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
\b
\q1
\c 91
\p
\v 1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under
the shadow of the Almighty.
\q1
\v 2 I will say of the LORD, \add He is\add* my refuge and my fortress: my
God; in him will I trust.
\q1
\v 3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, \add and
\add* from the noisome pestilence.
\q1
\v 4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou
trust: his truth \add shall be thy\add* shield and buckler.
\q1
\v 5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; \add nor\add* for the
arrow \add that\add* flieth by day;
\q1
\v 6 \add Nor\add* for the pestilence \add that\add* walketh in darkness; 
\add nor\add* for the destruction \add that\add* wasteth at noonday.
\q1
\v 7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; 
\add but\add* it shall not come nigh thee.
\q1
\v 8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
\q1
\v 9 Because thou hast made the LORD, \add which is\add* my refuge, 
\add even\add* the most High, thy habitation;
\q1
\v 10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy
dwelling.
\q1
\v 11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy
ways.
\q1
\v 12 They shall bear thee up in \add their\add* hands, lest thou dash thy
foot against a stone.
\q1
\v 13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon
shalt thou trample under feet.
\q1
\v 14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I
will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
\q1
\v 15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I \add will be\add* with
him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
\q1
\v 16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

\v 1 \add It is a\add* good \add thing\add* to give thanks unto the LORD, and
to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
\q1
\v 2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness
every night,
\q1
\v 3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp
with a solemn sound.
\q1
\v 4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the
works of thy hands.
\q1
\v 5 O LORD, how great are thy works! \add and\add* thy thoughts are very
deep.
\q1
\v 6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
\q1
\v 7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity
do flourish; \add it is\add* that they shall be destroyed for ever:
\q1
\v 8 But thou, LORD, \add art most\add* high for evermore.
\q1
\v 9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all
the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
\q1
\v 10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like \add the horn of\add* an unicorn: I
shall be anointed with fresh oil.
\q1
\v 11 Mine eye also shall see \add my desire\add* on mine enemies, \add and
\add* mine ears shall hear \add my desire\add* of the wicked that rise up
against me.
\q1
\v 12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a
cedar in Lebanon.
\q1
\v 13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the
courts of our God.
\q1
\v 14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and
flourishing;
\q1
\v 15 To shew that the LORD \add is\add* upright: \add he is\add* my rock, and
\add there is\add* no unrighteousness in him.
\b
\q1
\c 93

\v 3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice;

\v 3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
\q1
\v 4 \add How long\add* shall they utter \add and\add* speak hard things? 
\add and\add* all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
\q1
\v 5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.
\q1
\v 6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
\q1
\v 7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob
regard \add it.\add*
\q1
\v 8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and \add ye\add* fools, when
will ye be wise?
\q1
\v 9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall
he not see?
\q1
\v 10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth
man knowledge, \add shall not he know?\add*
\q1
\v 11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they \add are\add* vanity.
\q1
\v 12 Blessed \add is\add* the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
him out of thy law;
\q1
\v 13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit
be digged for the wicked.
\q1
\v 14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his
inheritance.
\q1
\v 15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in
heart shall follow it.
\q1
\v 16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? \add or\add* who will
stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
\q1
\v 17 Unless the LORD \add had been\add* my help, my soul had almost dwelt in

\q1
\v 20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth
mischief by a law?
\q1
\v 21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and
condemn the innocent blood.
\q1
\v 22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God \add is\add* the rock of my
refuge.
\q1
\v 23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off
in their own wickedness; \add yea,\add* the LORD our God shall cut them off.

pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
\q1
\v 8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, \add and as in\add* the day
of temptation in the wilderness:

\v 9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
\q1
\v 10 Forty years long was I grieved with \add this\add* generation, and said,
It \add is\add* a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known

\v 6 Mine eyes \add shall be\add* upon the faithful of the land, that they may
dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
\q1
\v 7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth
lies shall not tarry in my sight.
\q1
\v 8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all
wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

\d A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his
complaint before the LORD.
\p
\v 1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
\q1
\v 2 Hide not thy face from me in the day \add when\add* I am in trouble;
incline thine ear unto me: in the day \add when\add* I call answer me
speedily.
\q1
\v 3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an
hearth.
\q1
\v 4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my
bread.
\q1
\v 5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.
\q1
\v 6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
\q1
\v 7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
\q1
\v 8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; \add and\add* they that are mad
against me are sworn against me.
\q1
\v 9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,
\q1
\v 10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up,
and cast me down.
\q1
\v 11 My days \add are\add* like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
like grass.
\q1
\v 12 But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all
generations.
\q1
\v 13 Thou shalt arise, \add and\add* have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
\q1
\v 14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust
thereof.
\q1
\v 15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the
earth thy glory.
\q1
\v 16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.
\q1
\v 17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their
prayer.
\q1
\v 18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which
shall be created shall praise the LORD.
\q1
\v 19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven
did the LORD behold the earth;
\q1
\v 20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed
to death;
\q1
\v 21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
\q1
\v 22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the
LORD.
\q1
\v 23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
\q1
\v 24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years 
\add are\add* throughout all generations.
\q1
\v 25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens 
\add are\add* the work of thy hands.
\q1
\v 26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old
like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be
changed:
\q1
\v 27 But thou \add art\add* the same, and thy years shall have no end.
\q1
\v 28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be
established before thee.

\d A \add Psalm\add* of David.
\p
\v 1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, \add bless
\add* his holy name.
\q1
\v 2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
\q1
\v 3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
\q1
\v 4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with
lovingkindness and tender mercies;
\q1
\v 5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good \add things; so that\add* thy youth is
renewed like the eagle’s.
\q1
\v 6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
oppressed.
\q1
\v 7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
\q1
\v 8 The LORD \add is\add* merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous
in mercy.
\q1
\v 9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep \add his anger\add* for
ever.
\q1
\v 10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to
our iniquities.
\q1
\v 11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, \add so\add* great is his
mercy toward them that fear him.
\q1
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, \add so\add* far hath he removed
our transgressions from us.
\q1
\v 13 Like as a father pitieth \add his\add* children, \add so\add* the LORD
pitieth them that fear him.
\q1
\v 14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we \add are\add* dust.
\q1
\v 15 \add As for\add* man, his days \add are\add* as grass: as a flower of
the field, so he flourisheth.
\q1
\v 16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof
shall know it no more.
\q1
\v 17 But the mercy of the LORD \add is\add* from everlasting to everlasting
upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children’s children;
\q1
\v 18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
commandments to do them.
\q1
\v 19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth
over all.
\q1
\v 20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his
commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
\q1
\v 21 Bless ye the LORD, all \add ye\add* his hosts; \add ye\add* ministers of
his, that do his pleasure.
\q1
\v 22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the
LORD, O my soul.
\b
\q1
\c 104
\p
\v 1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art
clothed with honour and majesty.
\q1
\v 2 Who coverest \add thyself\add* with light as \add with\add* a garment:
who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
\q1
\v 3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds
his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
\q1
\v 4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
\q1
\v 5 \add Who\add* laid the foundations of the earth, \add that\add* it should
not be removed for ever.
\q1
\v 6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as \add with\add* a garment: the waters
stood above the mountains.
\q1
\v 7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
\q1
\v 8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place
which thou hast founded for them.
\q1
\v 9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not
again to cover the earth.
\q1
\v 10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, \add which\add* run among the
hills.
\q1
\v 11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their
thirst.
\q1
\v 12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, \add which
\add* sing among the branches.
\q1
\v 13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the
fruit of thy works.
\q1
\v 14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of
man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
\q1
\v 15 And wine \add that\add* maketh glad the heart of man, \add and
\add* oil to make \add his\add* face to shine, and bread \add which
\add* strengtheneth man’s heart.
\q1
\v 16 The trees of the LORD are full \add of sap;\add* the cedars of Lebanon,
which he hath planted;
\q1
\v 17 Where the birds make their nests: \add as for\add* the stork, the fir
trees \add are\add* her house.
\q1
\v 18 The high hills \add are\add* a refuge for the wild goats; \add and
\add* the rocks for the conies.
\q1
\v 19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
\q1
\v 20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the
forest do creep \add forth.\add*
\q1
\v 21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
\q1
\v 22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in
their dens.
\q1
\v 23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
\q1
\v 24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all:
the earth is full of thy riches.
\q1
\v 25 \add So is\add* this great and wide sea, wherein \add are\add* things
creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
\q1
\v 26 There go the ships: \add there is\add* that leviathan, \add whom
\add* thou hast made to play therein.
\q1
\v 27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give \add them\add* their
meat in due season.
\q1
\v 28 \add That\add* thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
they are filled with good.
\q1
\v 29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath,
they die, and return to their dust.
\q1
\v 30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the
face of the earth.
\q1
\v 31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in
his works.
\q1
\v 32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and
they smoke.
\q1
\v 33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my
God while I have my being.
\q1
\v 34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
\q1

\q1
\v 5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the
judgments of his mouth;
\q1
\v 6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
\q1
\v 7 He \add is\add* the LORD our God: his judgments \add are\add* in all the
earth.
\q1
\v 8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word \add which\add* he
commanded to a thousand generations.
\q1
\v 9 Which \add covenant\add* he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
\q1
\v 10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, \add and\add* to Israel 
\add for\add* an everlasting covenant:
\q1
\v 11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your
inheritance:
\q1
\v 12 When they were \add but\add* a few men in number; yea, very few, and
strangers in it.
\q1
\v 13 When they went from one nation to another, from \add one\add* kingdom to
another people;
\q1
\v 14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their
sakes;
\q1
\v 15 \add Saying,\add* Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
\q1
\v 16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff
of bread.
\q1
\v 17 He sent a man before them, \add even\add* Joseph, \add who\add* was sold
for a servant:
\q1
\v 18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
\q1
\v 19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
\q1
\v 20 The king sent and loosed him; \add even\add* the ruler of the people,
and let him go free.
\q1
\v 21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
\q1
\v 22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
\q1
\v 23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
\q1
\v 24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their
enemies.
\q1
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his
servants.
\q1
\v 26 He sent Moses his servant; \add and\add* Aaron whom he had chosen.
\q1
\v 27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
\q1
\v 28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his
word.
\q1
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
\q1
\v 30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their
kings.
\q1
\v 31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, \add and\add* lice in
all their coasts.
\q1
\v 32 He gave them hail for rain, \add and\add* flaming fire in their land.
\q1
\v 33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of
their coasts.
\q1
\v 34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without
number,
\q1
\v 35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of
their ground.
\q1
\v 36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their
strength.
\q1
\v 37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and \add there was
\add* not one feeble \add person\add* among their tribes.
\q1
\v 38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
\q1
\v 39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
\q1
\v 40 \add The people\add* asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
with the bread of heaven.
\q1
\v 41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry
places \add like\add* a river.
\q1
\v 42 For he remembered his holy promise, \add and\add* Abraham his servant.
\q1
\v 43 And he brought forth his people with joy, \add and\add* his chosen with
gladness:
\q1
\v 44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of
the people;
\q1
\v 45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the
LORD.
\b
\q1
\c 106
\p
\v 1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for \add he is
\add* good: for his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever.
\q1
\v 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? \add who\add* can shew forth
all his praise?
\q1
\v 3 Blessed \add are\add* they that keep judgment, \add and\add* he that
doeth righteousness at all times.
\q1
\v 4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour \add that thou bearest unto
\add* thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
\q1
\v 5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness
of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
\q1
\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done
wickedly.
\q1
\v 7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the
multitude of thy mercies; but provoked \add him\add* at the sea, \add even
\add* at the Red sea.
\q1
\v 8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his
mighty power to be known.
\q1
\v 9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through
the depths, as through the wilderness.
\q1
\v 10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated \add them,\add* and
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
\q1
\v 11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
\q1
\v 12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
\q1
\v 13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
\q1
\v 14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the
desert.
\q1
\v 15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
\q1
\v 16 They envied Moses also in the camp, \add and\add* Aaron the saint of the
LORD.
\q1
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of
Abiram.
\q1
\v 18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the
wicked.
\q1
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
\q1
\v 20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth
grass.
\q1
\v 21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
\q1
\v 22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, \add and\add* terrible things by the
Red sea.
\q1
\v 23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen
stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy
\add them.\add*
\q1
\v 24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
\q1
\v 25 But murmured in their tents, \add and\add* hearkened not unto the voice
of the LORD.
\q1
\v 26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the
wilderness:
\q1
\v 27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in
the lands.
\q1
\v 28 They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of
the dead.
\q1
\v 29 Thus they provoked \add him\add* to anger with their inventions: and the
plague brake in upon them.
\q1
\v 30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and \add so\add* the
plague was stayed.
\q1
\v 31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for
evermore.
\q1
\v 32 They angered \add him\add* also at the waters of strife, so that it went
ill with Moses for their sakes:
\q1
\v 33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his
lips.
\q1
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded
them:
\q1
\v 35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
\q1
\v 36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
\q1
\v 37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
\q1
\v 38 And shed innocent blood, \add even\add* the blood of their sons and of
their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land
was polluted with blood.
\q1
\v 39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with
their own inventions.
\q1
\v 40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch
that he abhorred his own inheritance.
\q1
\v 41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them
ruled over them.
\q1
\v 42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection
under their hand.
\q1
\v 43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked \add him\add* with
their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
\q1
\v 44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
\q1
\v 45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the
multitude of his mercies.
\q1
\v 46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
\q1
\v 47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give
thanks unto thy holy name, \add and\add* to triumph in thy praise.
\q1
\v 48 Blessed \add be\add* the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to

\p
\v 1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for \add he is\add* good: for his mercy 
\add endureth\add* for ever.
\q1
\v 2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand
of the enemy;
\q1
\v 3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west,
from the north, and from the south.
\q1
\v 4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to
dwell in.
\q1
\v 5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
\q1
\v 6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \add and\add* he
delivered them out of their distresses.
\q1
\v 7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of
habitation.
\q1
\v 8 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the LORD \add for\add* his goodness,
and \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men!
\q1
\v 9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with
goodness.
\q1
\v 10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, \add being
\add* bound in affliction and iron;
\q1
\v 11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the
counsel of the most High:
\q1
\v 12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and 
\add there was\add* none to help.
\q1
\v 13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, \add and\add* he saved
them out of their distresses.
\q1
\v 14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their
bands in sunder.
\q1
\v 15 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the LORD \add for\add* his goodness,
and \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men!
\q1
\v 16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in
sunder.
\q1
\v 17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities,
are afflicted.
\q1
\v 18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the
gates of death.
\q1
\v 19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, \add and\add* he saveth
them out of their distresses.
\q1
\v 20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered \add them\add* from
their destructions.
\q1
\v 21 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the LORD \add for\add* his goodness,
and \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men!
\q1
\v 22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his
works with rejoicing.
\q1
\v 23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great
waters;
\q1
\v 24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
\q1
\v 25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the
waves thereof.
\q1
\v 26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their
soul is melted because of trouble.
\q1
\v 27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their
wit’s end.
\q1
\v 28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out
of their distresses.
\q1
\v 29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
\q1
\v 30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their
desired haven.
\q1
\v 31 Oh that \add men\add* would praise the LORD \add for\add* his goodness,
and \add for\add* his wonderful works to the children of men!
\q1
\v 32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise
him in the assembly of the elders.
\q1
\v 33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry
ground;
\q1
\v 34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell
therein.
\q1
\v 35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into
watersprings.
\q1
\v 36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city
for habitation;
\q1
\v 37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of
increase.
\q1
\v 38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and
suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
\q1
\v 39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction,
and sorrow.
\q1
\v 40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the
wilderness, \add where there is\add* no way.
\q1
\v 41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh \add him
\add* families like a flock.

\d To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
\q1
\v 2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened
against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
\q1
\v 3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me
without a cause.
\q1
\v 4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I \add give myself unto
\add* prayer.
\q1
\v 5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
\q1
\v 6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.
\q1
\v 7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become
sin.
\q1
\v 8 Let his days be few; \add and\add* let another take his office.
\q1
\v 9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
\q1
\v 10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek 
\add their bread\add* also out of their desolate places.
\q1
\v 11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil
his labour.
\q1
\v 12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to
favour his fatherless children.
\q1
\v 13 Let his posterity be cut off; \add and\add* in the generation following
let their name be blotted out.
\q1
\v 14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not
the sin of his mother be blotted out.
\q1
\v 15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory
of them from the earth.
\q1
\v 16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor
and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
\q1
\v 17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in
blessing, so let it be far from him.
\q1
\v 18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it
come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
\q1
\v 19 Let it be unto him as the garment \add which\add* covereth him, and for
a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
\q1
\v 20 \add Let\add* this \add be\add* the reward of mine adversaries from the
LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
\q1
\v 21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name’s sake: because thy
mercy \add is\add* good, deliver thou me.
\q1
\v 22 For I \add am\add* poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
\q1
\v 23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as
the locust.
\q1
\v 24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
\q1
\v 25 I became also a reproach unto them: \add when\add* they looked upon me
they shaked their heads.
\q1
\v 26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
\q1
\v 27 That they may know that this \add is\add* thy hand; \add that
\add* thou, LORD, hast done it.
\q1
\v 28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed;
but let thy servant rejoice.
\q1
\v 29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
\q1
\v 30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him
among the multitude.
\q1
\v 31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save \add him
\add* from those that condemn his soul.
