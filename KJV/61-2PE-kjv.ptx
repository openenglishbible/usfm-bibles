\h 2 Peter
\mt The Second Epistle General of Peter 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have
obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our
Saviour Jesus Christ: 
\v 2 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and
of Jesus our Lord, 
\v 3 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that 
\add pertain\add* unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that
hath called us to glory and virtue: 
\v 4 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by
these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the
corruption that is in the world through lust. 
\v 5 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to
virtue knowledge; 
\v 6 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience
godliness; 
\v 7 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity. 
\v 8 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make \add you that ye
shall\add* neither \add be\add* barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our
Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 9 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and
hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins. 
\v 10 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and
election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall: 
\v 11 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the
everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 12 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of
these things, though ye know \add them,\add* and be established in the present
truth. 
\v 13 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up
by putting \add you\add* in remembrance; 
\v 14 Knowing that shortly I must put off \add this\add* my tabernacle, even
as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me. 
\v 15 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have
these things always in remembrance. 
\v 16 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known
unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses
of his majesty. 
\v 17 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came
such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom
I am well pleased. 
\v 18 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in
the holy mount. 
\v 19 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye
take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn,
and the day star arise in your hearts: 
\v 20 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private
interpretation. 
\v 21 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men
of God spake \add as they were\add* moved by the Holy Ghost.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall
be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies,
even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift
destruction. 
\v 2 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of
truth shall be evil spoken of. 
\v 3 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise
of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation
slumbereth not. 
\v 4 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast \add them
\add* down to hell, and delivered \add them\add* into chains of darkness, to
be reserved unto judgment; 
\v 5 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth \add person,
\add* a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the
ungodly; 
\v 6 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned 
\add them\add* with an overthrow, making \add them\add* an ensample unto those
that after should live ungodly; 
\v 7 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the
wicked: 
\v 8 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed
\add his\add* righteous soul from day to day with \add their\add* unlawful
deeds;) 
\v 9 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to
reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished: 
\v 10 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness,
and despise government. Presumptuous \add are they,\add* selfwilled, they are
not afraid to speak evil of dignities. 
\v 11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing
accusation against them before the Lord. 
\v 12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed,
speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in
their own corruption; 
\v 13 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, \add as\add* they that
count it pleasure to riot in the daytime. Spots \add they are\add* and
blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with
you; 
\v 14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling
unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed
children: 
\v 15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the
way of Balaam \add the son\add* of Bosor, who loved the wages of
unrighteousness; 
\v 16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man’s voice
forbad the madness of the prophet. 
\v 17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest;
to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. 
\v 18 For when they speak great swelling \add words\add* of vanity, they
allure through the lusts of the flesh, \add through much\add* wantonness,
those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. 
\v 19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of
corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in
bondage. 
\v 20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the
knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled
therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. 
\v 21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
righteousness, than, after they have known \add it,\add* to turn from the holy
commandment delivered unto them. 
\v 22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog 
\add is\add* turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her
wallowing in the mire.

\p
\v 1 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in \add both
\add* which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance: 
\v 2 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy
prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour: 
\v 3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers,
walking after their own lusts, 
\v 4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers
fell asleep, all things continue as \add they were\add* from the beginning of
the creation. 
\v 5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the
heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the
water: 
\v 6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished: 
\v 7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept
in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of
ungodly men. 
\v 8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day \add is
\add* with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 
\v 9 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count
slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should
perish, but that all should come to repentance. 
\v 10 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which
the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt
with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be
burned up. 
\v 11 \add Seeing\add* then \add that\add* all these things shall be
dissolved, what manner \add of persons\add* ought ye to be in \add all
\add* holy conversation and godliness, 
\v 12 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the
heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with
fervent heat? 
\v 13 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a
new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 
\v 14 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent
that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. 
\v 15 And account \add that\add* the longsuffering of our Lord \add is
\add* salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom
given unto him hath written unto you; 
\v 16 As also in all \add his\add* epistles, speaking in them of these things;
in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned
and unstable wrest, as \add they do\add* also the other scriptures, unto their
own destruction. 
\v 17 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know \add these things\add* before,
beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from
your own stedfastness. 
\v 18 But grow in grace, and \add in\add* the knowledge of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ. To him \add be\add* glory both now and for ever. Amen.
