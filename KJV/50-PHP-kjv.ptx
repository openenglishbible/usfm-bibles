\mt The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Philippians 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in
Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons: 
\v 2 Grace \add be\add* unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and 
\add from\add* the Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 3 I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 
\v 4 Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy, 
\v 5 For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now; 
\v 6 Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work
in you will perform \add it\add* until the day of Jesus Christ: 
\v 7 Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in
my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of
the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace. 
\v 8 For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of
Jesus Christ. 
\v 9 And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge
and \add in\add* all judgment; 
\v 10 That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere
and without offence till the day of Christ; 
\v 11 Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus
Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
\p
\v 12 But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things \add which
happened\add* unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the
gospel; 
\v 13 So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all
other \add places; \add*
\v 14 And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are
much more bold to speak the word without fear. 
\v 15 Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good
will: 
\v 16 The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add
affliction to my bonds: 
\v 17 But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the
gospel. 
\v 18 What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth,
Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. 
\v 19 For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and
the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 
\v 20 According to my earnest expectation and \add my\add* hope, that in
nothing I shall be ashamed, but \add that\add* with all boldness, as always, 
\add so\add* now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether 
\add it be\add* by life, or by death. 
\v 21 For to me to live \add is\add* Christ, and to die \add is\add* gain. 
\v 22 But if I live in the flesh, this \add is\add* the fruit of my labour:
yet what I shall choose I wot not. 
\v 23 For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be
with Christ; which is far better: 
\v 24 Nevertheless to abide in the flesh \add is\add* more needful for you. 
\v 25 And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with
you all for your furtherance and joy of faith; 
\v 26 That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my
coming to you again. 
\v 27 Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that
whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs,
that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the
faith of the gospel; 
\v 28 And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an
evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God. 
\v 29 For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on
him, but also to suffer for his sake; 
\v 30 Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear \add to be
\add* in me.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 If \add there be\add* therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort
of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, 
\v 2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, 
\add being\add* of one accord, of one mind. 
\v 3 \add Let\add* nothing \add be done\add* through strife or vainglory; but
in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves. 
\v 4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of
others. 
\v 5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: 
\v 6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with
God: 
\v 7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a
servant, and was made in the likeness of men: 
\v 8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became
obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. 
\v 9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is
above every name: 
\v 10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of \add things
\add* in heaven, and \add things\add* in earth, and \add things\add* under the
earth; 
\v 11 And \add that\add* every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ 
\add is\add* Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
\p
\v 12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence
only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear
and trembling. 
\v 13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of \add his
\add* good pleasure. 
\v 14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings: 
\v 15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke,
in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights
in the world; 
\v 16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ,
that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain. 
\v 17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I
joy, and rejoice with you all. 
\v 18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.
\p
\v 19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I
also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 
\v 20 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state. 
\v 21 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s. 
\v 22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath
served with me in the gospel. 
\v 23 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it
will go with me. 
\v 24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly. 
\v 25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and
companion in labour, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that
ministered to my wants. 
\v 26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye
had heard that he had been sick. 
\v 27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and
not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 
\v 28 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye
may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful. 
\v 29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in
reputation: 
\v 30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his
life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to
you, to me indeed \add is\add* not grievous, but for you \add it is
\add* safe.
\p
\v 2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision. 
\v 3 For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice
in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. 
\v 4 Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man
thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more: 
\v 5 Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, \add of\add* the
tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;
\v 6 Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which
is in the law, blameless. 
\v 7 But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ. 
\v 8 Yea doubtless, and I count all things \add but\add* loss for the
excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered
the loss of all things, and do count them \add but\add* dung, that I may win
Christ, 
\v 9 And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the
law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is
of God by faith: 
\v 10 That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the
fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death; 
\v 11 If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead. 
\v 12 Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I
follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of
Christ Jesus. 
\v 13 Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but \add this
\add* one thing \add I do,\add* forgetting those things which are behind, and
reaching forth unto those things which are before, 
\v 14 I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in
Christ Jesus. 
\v 15 Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any
thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you. 
\v 16 Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same
rule, let us mind the same thing. 
\v 17 Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye
have us for an ensample. 
\v 18 (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even
weeping, \add that they are\add* the enemies of the cross of Christ: 
\v 19 Whose end \add is\add* destruction, whose God \add is their\add* belly,
and \add whose\add* glory \add is\add* in their shame, who mind earthly
things.) 
\v 20 For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the
Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ: 
\v 21 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his
glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all
things unto himself.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown,
so stand fast in the Lord, \add my\add* dearly beloved. 
\v 2 I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in
the Lord. 
\v 3 And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured
with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and \add with\add* other my
fellowlabourers, whose names \add are\add* in the book of life. 
\v 4 Rejoice in the Lord alway: \add and\add* again I say, Rejoice. 
\v 5 Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord \add is\add* at
hand. 
\v 6 Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication
with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God. 
\v 7 And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your
hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. 
\v 8 Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things 
\add are\add* honest, whatsoever things \add are\add* just, whatsoever things
\add are\add* pure, whatsoever things \add are\add* lovely, whatsoever things
\add are\add* of good report; if \add there be\add* any virtue, and if 
\add there be\add* any praise, think on these things. 
\v 9 Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and
seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.
\p
\v 10 But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me
hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked
opportunity. 
\v 11 Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever
state I am, \add therewith\add* to be content. 
\v 12 I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and
in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound
and to suffer need. 
\v 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me. 
\v 14 Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my
affliction. 
\v 15 Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when
I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving
and receiving, but ye only. 
\v 16 For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity. 
\v 17 Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your
account. 
\v 18 But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus
the things \add which were sent\add* from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a
sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God. 
\v 19 But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory
by Christ Jesus. 
\v 20 Now unto God and our Father \add be\add* glory for ever and ever. Amen.
\p
\v 21 Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet
you. 
\v 22 All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar’s household.
\p
\v 23 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ \add be\add* with you all. Amen.
