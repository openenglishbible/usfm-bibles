\h Hosea
\mt Hosea 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri, in the days
of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, \add and\add* Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the
days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel. 
\v 2 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to
Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms: for
the land hath committed great whoredom, \add departing\add* from the LORD. 
\v 3 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which conceived, and
bare him a son. 
\v 4 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a little 
\add while,\add* and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of
Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. 
\v 5 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the bow of
Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
\p
\v 6 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And \add God\add* said unto
him, Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the house of
Israel; but I will utterly take them away. 
\v 7 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the
LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by
horses, nor by horsemen.
\p
\v 8 Now when she had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. 
\v 9 Then said \add God,\add* Call his name Lo-ammi: for ye \add are
\add* not my people, and I will not be your \add God.\add*
\p
\v 10 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the
sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, 
\add that\add* in the place where it was said unto them, Ye \add are
\add* not my people, \add there\add* it shall be said unto them, \add Ye are
\add* the sons of the living God. 
\v 11 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be gathered
together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the
land: for great \add shall be\add* the day of Jezreel.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ru-hamah. 
\v 2 Plead with your mother, plead: for she \add is\add* not my wife, neither
\add am\add* I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of
her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts; 
\v 3 Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and
make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry land, and slay her with
thirst. 
\v 4 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they \add be\add* the
children of whoredoms. 
\v 5 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived them hath
done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give 
\add me\add* my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my
drink.
\p
\v 6 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and make a wall,
that she shall not find her paths. 
\v 7 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them;
and she shall seek them, but shall not find \add them:\add* then shall she
say, I will go and return to my first husband; for then \add was it
\add* better with me than now. 
\v 8 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and
multiplied her silver and gold, \add which\add* they prepared for Baal. 
\v 9 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time thereof, and
my wine in the season thereof, and will recover my wool and my flax 
\add given\add* to cover her nakedness. 
\v 10 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers, and
none shall deliver her out of mine hand. 
\v 11 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her new moons,
and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts. 
\v 12 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she hath said,
These \add are\add* my rewards that my lovers have given me: and I will make
them a forest, and the beasts of the field shall eat them. 
\v 13 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she burned incense
to them, and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went
after her lovers, and forgat me, saith the LORD.
\p
\v 14 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness,
and speak comfortably unto her. 
\v 15 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor
for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and
as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 16 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, \add that\add* thou shalt
call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali. 
\v 17 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and they
shall no more be remembered by their name. 
\v 18 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the
field, and with the fowls of heaven, and \add with\add* the creeping things of
the ground: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the
earth, and will make them to lie down safely. 
\v 19 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto
me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies. 
\v 20 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou shalt know
the LORD. 
\v 21 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the LORD, I
will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth; 
\v 22 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they
shall hear Jezreel. 
\v 23 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon her
that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to \add them which were
\add* not my people, Thou \add art\add* my people; and they shall say, 
\add Thou art\add* my God.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of \add her
\add* friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the
children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine. 
\v 2 So I bought her to me for fifteen \add pieces\add* of silver, and 
\add for\add* an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley: 
\v 3 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not
play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for \add another\add* man: so 
\add will\add* I also \add be\add* for thee. 
\v 4 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and
without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without
an ephod, and \add without\add* teraphim: 
\v 5 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their
God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the
latter days.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a
controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because \add there is
\add* no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. 
\v 2 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing
adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood. 
\v 3 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall
languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the
fishes of the sea also shall be taken away. 
\v 4 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people \add are
\add* as they that strive with the priest. 
\v 5 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall
with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
\p
\v 6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected
knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing
thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children. 
\v 7 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: \add therefore
\add* will I change their glory into shame. 
\v 8 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their
iniquity. 
\v 9 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for
their ways, and reward them their doings. 
\v 10 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and
shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD. 
\v 11 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
\p
\v 12 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto
them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused \add them\add* to err, and they
have gone a whoring from under their God. 
\v 13 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the
hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof \add is
\add* good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses
shall commit adultery. 
\v 14 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your
spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores,
and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people \add that\add* doth not
understand shall fall.
\p
\v 15 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, \add yet\add* let not Judah
offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear,
The LORD liveth. 
\v 16 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed
them as a lamb in a large place. 
\v 17 Ephraim \add is\add* joined to idols: let him alone. 
\v 18 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her
rulers \add with\add* shame do love, Give ye. 
\v 19 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed
because of their sacrifices.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye
ear, O house of the king; for judgment \add is\add* toward you, because ye
have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 
\v 2 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I \add have
been\add* a rebuker of them all. 
\v 3 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou
committest whoredom, \add and\add* Israel is defiled. 
\v 4 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for the spirit
of whoredoms \add is\add* in the midst of them, and they have not known the
LORD. 
\v 5 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel
and Ephraim fall in their iniquity; Judah also shall fall with them. 
\v 6 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD;
but they shall not find \add him;\add* he hath withdrawn himself from them. 
\v 7 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have begotten
strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions. 
\v 8 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, \add and\add* the trumpet in Ramah: cry
aloud \add at\add* Beth-aven, after thee, O Benjamin. 
\v 9 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of
Israel have I made known that which shall surely be. 
\v 10 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: \add therefore
\add* I will pour out my wrath upon them like water. 
\v 11 Ephraim \add is\add* oppressed \add and\add* broken in judgment, because
he willingly walked after the commandment. 
\v 12 Therefore \add will\add* I \add be\add* unto Ephraim as a moth, and to
the house of Judah as rottenness. 
\v 13 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah \add saw\add* his wound, then
went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet could he not heal
you, nor cure you of your wound. 
\v 14 For I will \add be\add* unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to
the house of Judah: I, \add even\add* I, will tear and go away; I will take
away, and none shall rescue \add him.\add*
\p
\v 15 I will go \add and\add* return to my place, till they acknowledge their
offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal
us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. 
\v 2 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up,
and we shall live in his sight. 
\v 3 Then shall we know, \add if\add* we follow on to know the LORD: his going
forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as
the latter \add and\add* former rain unto the earth.
\p
\v 4 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee?
for your goodness \add is\add* as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it
goeth away. 
\v 5 Therefore have I hewed \add them\add* by the prophets; I have slain them
by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments \add are as\add* the light 
\add that\add* goeth forth. 
\v 6 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more
than burnt offerings. 
\v 7 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt
treacherously against me. 
\v 8 Gilead \add is\add* a city of them that work iniquity, \add and is
\add* polluted with blood. 
\v 9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, \add so\add* the company of
priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness. 
\v 10 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there \add is
\add* the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled. 
\v 11 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the
captivity of my people.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was
discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the
thief cometh in, \add and\add* the troop of robbers spoileth without. 
\v 2 And they consider not in their hearts \add that\add* I remember all their
wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my
face. 
\v 3 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their
lies. 
\v 4 They \add are\add* all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, 
\add who\add* ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it
be leavened. 
\v 5 In the day of our king the princes have made \add him\add* sick with
bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners. 
\v 6 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in
wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a
flaming fire. 
\v 7 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their
kings are fallen: \add there is\add* none among them that calleth unto me. 
\v 8 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not
turned. 
\v 9 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth \add it\add* not:
yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. 
\v 10 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return
to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.
\p
\v 11 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt,
they go to Assyria. 
\v 12 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them
down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation
hath heard. 
\v 13 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!
because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet
they have spoken lies against me. 
\v 14 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon
their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, \add and\add* they
rebel against me. 
\v 15 Though I have bound \add and\add* strengthened their arms, yet do they
imagine mischief against me. 
\v 16 They return, \add but\add* not to the most High: they are like a
deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their
tongue: this \add shall be\add* their derision in the land of Egypt.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 \add Set\add* the trumpet to thy mouth. \add He shall come\add* as an
eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my
covenant, and trespassed against my law. 
\v 2 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee. 
\v 3 Israel hath cast off \add the thing that is\add* good: the enemy shall
pursue him. 
\v 4 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew
\add it\add* not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols,
that they may be cut off.
\p
\v 5 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast \add thee\add* off; mine anger is kindled
against them: how long \add will it be\add* ere they attain to innocency? 
\v 6 For from Israel \add was\add* it also: the workman made it; therefore it
\add is\add* not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces. 
\v 7 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath
no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall
swallow it up. 
\v 8 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel
wherein \add is\add* no pleasure. 
\v 9 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim
hath hired lovers. 
\v 10 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them,
and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes. 
\v 11 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him
to sin. 
\v 12 I have written to him the great things of my law, \add but\add* they
were counted as a strange thing. 
\v 13 They sacrifice flesh \add for\add* the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
\add eat it;\add* but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their
iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. 
\v 14 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah
hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it
shall devour the palaces thereof.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as \add other\add* people: for thou hast
gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor. 
\v 2 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall
fail in her. 
\v 3 They shall not dwell in the LORD’S land; but Ephraim shall return to
Egypt, and they shall eat unclean \add things\add* in Assyria. 
\v 4 They shall not offer wine \add offerings\add* to the LORD, neither shall
they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices \add shall be\add* unto them as
the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread
for their soul shall not come into the house of the LORD. 
\v 5 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the
LORD? 
\v 6 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall gather them
up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant \add places\add* for their silver,
nettles shall possess them: thorns \add shall be\add* in their tabernacles. 
\v 7 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel
shall know \add it:\add* the prophet \add is\add* a fool, the spiritual man 
\add is\add* mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred. 
\v 8 The watchman of Ephraim \add was\add* with my God: \add but\add* the
prophet \add is\add* a snare of a fowler in all his ways, \add and\add* hatred
in the house of his God. 
\v 9 They have deeply corrupted \add themselves,\add* as in the days of
Gibeah: \add therefore\add* he will remember their iniquity, he will visit
their sins. 
\v 10 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the
firstripe in the fig tree at her first time: \add but\add* they went to
Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto \add that\add* shame; and \add their
\add* abominations were according as they loved. 
\v 11 \add As for\add* Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from
the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception. 
\v 12 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, 
\add that there shall\add* not \add be\add* a man \add left:\add* yea, woe
also to them when I depart from them! 
\v 13 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, \add is\add* planted in a pleasant place: but
Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer. 
\v 14 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and
dry breasts. 
\v 15 All their wickedness \add is\add* in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for
the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house, I will
love them no more: all their princes \add are\add* revolters. 
\v 16 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit:
yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay \add even\add* the beloved 
\add fruit\add* of their womb. 
\v 17 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and
they shall be wanderers among the nations.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Israel \add is\add* an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars;
according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images. 
\v 2 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break
down their altars, he shall spoil their images. 
\v 3 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD;
what then should a king do to us? 
\v 4 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus
judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field. 
\v 5 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven:
for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof 
\add that\add* rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed
from it. 
\v 6 It shall be also carried unto Assyria \add for\add* a present to king
Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own
counsel. 
\v 7 \add As for\add* Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the
water. 
\v 8 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the
thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the
mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us. 
\v 9 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the
battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them. 
\v 10 \add It is\add* in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people
shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two
furrows. 
\v 11 And Ephraim \add is as\add* an heifer \add that is\add* taught, 
\add and\add* loveth to tread out \add the corn;\add* but I passed over upon
her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, \add and
\add* Jacob shall break his clods. 
\v 12 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow
ground: for \add it is\add* time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain
righteousness upon you. 
\v 13 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the
fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy
mighty men. 
\v 14 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses
shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth- arbel in the day of battle: the
mother was dashed in pieces upon \add her\add* children. 
\v 15 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a
morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 When Israel \add was\add* a child, then I loved him, and called my son
out of Egypt. 
\v 2 \add As\add* they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed
unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images. 
\v 3 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not
that I healed them. 
\v 4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as
they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.
\p
\v 5 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his
king, because they refused to return. 
\v 6 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches,
and devour \add them,\add* because of their own counsels. 
\v 7 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to
the most High, none at all would exalt \add him. \add*
\v 8 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? \add how\add* shall I deliver thee,
Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? \add how\add* shall I set thee as
Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together. 
\v 9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to
destroy Ephraim: for I \add am\add* God, and not man; the Holy One in the
midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city. 
\v 10 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall
roar, then the children shall tremble from the west. 
\v 11 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land
of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD. 
\v 12 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with
deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily
increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the
Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt. 
\v 2 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob
according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him. 
\v 3 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had
power with God: 
\v 4 Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made
supplication unto him: he found him \add in\add* Bethel, and there he spake
with us; 
\v 5 Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD \add is\add* his memorial. 
\v 6 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy
God continually.
\p
\v 7 \add He is\add* a merchant, the balances of deceit \add are\add* in his
hand: he loveth to oppress. 
\v 8 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: 
\add in\add* all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that 
\add were\add* sin. 
\v 9 And I \add that am\add* the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast. 
\v 10 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and
used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets. 
\v 11 \add Is there\add* iniquity \add in\add* Gilead? surely they are vanity:
they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars \add are\add* as heaps in
the furrows of the fields. 
\v 12 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife,
and for a wife he kept \add sheep. \add*
\v 13 And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet
was he preserved. 
\v 14 Ephraim provoked \add him\add* to anger most bitterly: therefore shall
he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he
offended in Baal, he died. 
\v 2 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their
silver, \add and\add* idols according to their own understanding, all of it
the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss
the calves. 
\v 3 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that
passeth away, as the chaff \add that\add* is driven with the whirlwind out of
the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney. 
\v 4 Yet I \add am\add* the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou
shalt know no god but me: for \add there is\add* no saviour beside me.
\p
\v 5 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great drought. 
\v 6 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and
their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me. 
\v 7 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I
observe \add them: \add*
\v 8 I will meet them as a bear \add that is\add* bereaved \add of her
whelps,\add* and will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour
them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them. 
\v 9 O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me \add is\add* thine
help. 
\v 10 I will be thy king: where \add is any other\add* that may save thee in
all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and
princes? 
\v 11 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took \add him\add* away in my
wrath. 
\v 12 The iniquity of Ephraim \add is\add* bound up; his sin \add is
\add* hid. 
\v 13 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he \add is
\add* an unwise son; for he should not stay long in \add the place of
\add* the breaking forth of children. 
\v 14 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from
death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction:
repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.
\p
\v 15 Though he be fruitful among \add his\add* brethren, an east wind shall
come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring
shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the
treasure of all pleasant vessels. 
\v 16 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God:
they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and
their women with child shall be ripped up.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine
iniquity. 
\v 2 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all
iniquity, and receive \add us\add* graciously: so will we render the calves of
our lips. 
\v 3 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we
say any more to the work of our hands, \add Ye are\add* our gods: for in thee
the fatherless findeth mercy.
\p
\v 4 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is
turned away from him. 
\v 5 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast
forth his roots as Lebanon. 
\v 6 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and
his smell as Lebanon. 
\v 7 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive 
\add as\add* the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof \add shall be
\add* as the wine of Lebanon. 
\v 8 Ephraim \add shall say,\add* What have I to do any more with idols? I
have heard \add him,\add* and observed him: I \add am\add* like a green fir
tree. From me is thy fruit found. 
\v 9 Who \add is\add* wise, and he shall understand these \add things?
\add* prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD \add are
\add* right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall
therein.
