\h Job
\mt The Book of Job 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name \add was\add* Job; and that
man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 
\v 2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. 
\v 3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels,
and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great
household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. 
\v 4 And his sons went and feasted \add in their\add* houses, every one his
day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with
them. 
\v 5 And it was so, when the days of \add their\add* feasting were gone about,
that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and
offered burnt offerings \add according\add* to the number of them all: for Job
said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus
did Job continually.
\p
\v 6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. 
\v 7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the
LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and
down in it. 
\v 8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that 
\add there is\add* none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? 
\v 9 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? 
\v 10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about
all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and
his substance is increased in the land. 
\v 11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will
curse thee to thy face. 
\v 12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath \add is
\add* in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went
forth from the presence of the LORD.
\p
\v 13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters \add were
\add* eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house: 
\v 14 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing,
and the asses feeding beside them: 
\v 15 And the Sabeans fell \add upon them,\add* and took them away; yea, they
have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped
alone to tell thee. 
\v 16 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the
servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 17 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried
them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 18 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
Thy sons and thy daughters \add were\add* eating and drinking wine in their
eldest brother’s house: 
\v 19 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the
four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead;
and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 
\v 20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down
upon the ground, and worshipped, 
\v 21 And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return
thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of
the LORD. 
\v 22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves
before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the
LORD. 
\v 2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered
the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up
and down in it. 
\v 3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that 
\add there is\add* none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man,
one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his
integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without
cause. 
\v 4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man
hath will he give for his life. 
\v 5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he
will curse thee to thy face. 
\v 6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he \add is\add* in thine hand; but
save his life.
\p
\v 7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with
sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown. 
\v 8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down
among the ashes.
\p
\v 9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?
curse God, and die. 
\v 10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women
speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not
receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
\p
\v 11 Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon
him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad
the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment
together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him. 
\v 12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they
lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and
sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven. 
\v 13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights,
and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that \add his\add* grief was very
great.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day. 
\v 2 And Job spake, and said, 
\v 3 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night \add in which
\add* it was said, There is a man child conceived. 
\v 4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let
the light shine upon it. 
\v 5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it;
let the blackness of the day terrify it. 
\v 6 As \add for\add* that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the
months. 
\v 7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein. 
\v 8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their
mourning. 
\v 9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but
\add have\add* none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 
\v 10 Because it shut not up the doors of my \add mother’s\add* womb, nor hid
sorrow from mine eyes. 
\v 11 Why died I not from the womb? \add why\add* did I \add not\add* give up
the ghost when I came out of the belly? 
\v 12 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck? 
\v 13 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept:
then had I been at rest, 
\v 14 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built desolate places for
themselves; 
\v 15 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: 
\v 16 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants \add which
\add* never saw light. 
\v 17 There the wicked cease \add from\add* troubling; and there the weary be
at rest. 
\v 18 \add There\add* the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of
the oppressor. 
\v 19 The small and great are there; and the servant \add is\add* free from
his master. 
\v 20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the
bitter \add in\add* soul; 
\v 21 Which long for death, but it \add cometh\add* not; and dig for it more
than for hid treasures; 
\v 22 Which rejoice exceedingly, \add and\add* are glad, when they can find
the grave? 
\v 23 \add Why is light given\add* to a man whose way is hid, and whom God
hath hedged in? 
\v 24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like
the waters. 
\v 25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I
was afraid of is come unto me. 
\v 26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet
trouble came.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
\v 2 \add If\add* we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who
can withhold himself from speaking? 
\v 3 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak
hands. 
\v 4 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened
the feeble knees. 
\v 5 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and
thou art troubled. 
\v 6 \add Is\add* not \add this\add* thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and
the uprightness of thy ways? 
\v 7 Remember, I pray thee, who \add ever\add* perished, being innocent? or
where were the righteous cut off? 
\v 8 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap
the same. 
\v 9 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are
they consumed. 
\v 10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth
of the young lions, are broken. 
\v 11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are
scattered abroad. 
\v 12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little
thereof. 
\v 13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on
men, 
\v 14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. 
\v 15 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up: 
\v 16 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image 
\add was\add* before mine eyes, \add there was\add* silence, and I heard a
voice, \add saying, \add*
\v 17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than
his maker? 
\v 18 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with
folly: 
\v 19 How much less \add in\add* them that dwell in houses of clay, whose
foundation \add is\add* in the dust, \add which\add* are crushed before the
moth? 
\v 20 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without
any regarding \add it. \add*
\v 21 Doth not their excellency \add which is\add* in them go away? they die,
even without wisdom.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the
saints wilt thou turn? 
\v 2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one. 
\v 3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
habitation. 
\v 4 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate,
neither \add is there\add* any to deliver \add them. \add*
\v 5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns,
and the robber swalloweth up their substance. 
\v 6 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble
spring out of the ground; 
\v 7 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward. 
\v 8 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 
\v 9 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without
number: 
\v 10 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields: 
\v 11 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be
exalted to safety. 
\v 12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot
perform \add their\add* enterprise. 
\v 13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the
froward is carried headlong. 
\v 14 They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in
the night. 
\v 15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the
hand of the mighty. 
\v 16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth. 
\v 17 Behold, happy \add is\add* the man whom God correcteth: therefore
despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty: 
\v 18 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make
whole. 
\v 19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil
touch thee. 
\v 20 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of
the sword. 
\v 21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be
afraid of destruction when it cometh. 
\v 22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid
of the beasts of the earth. 
\v 23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts
of the field shall be at peace with thee. 
\v 24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle \add shall be\add* in peace; and
thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin. 
\v 25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed \add shall be\add* great, and thine
offspring as the grass of the earth. 
\v 26 Thou shalt come to \add thy\add* grave in a full age, like as a shock of
corn cometh in in his season. 
\v 27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it \add is;\add* hear it, and know thou
\add it\add* for thy good.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 But Job answered and said, 
\v 2 O that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the
balances together! 
\v 3 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words
are swallowed up. 
\v 4 For the arrows of the Almighty \add are\add* within me, the poison
whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array
against me. 
\v 5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his
fodder? 
\v 6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there 
\add any\add* taste in the white of an egg? 
\v 7 The things \add that\add* my soul refused to touch \add are\add* as my
sorrowful meat. 
\v 8 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant \add me
\add* the thing that I long for! 
\v 9 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his
hand, and cut me off! 
\v 10 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow:
let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One. 
\v 11 What \add is\add* my strength, that I should hope? and what \add is
\add* mine end, that I should prolong my life? 
\v 12 \add Is\add* my strength the strength of stones? or \add is\add* my
flesh of brass? 
\v 13 \add Is\add* not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me? 
\v 14 To him that is afflicted pity \add should be shewed\add* from his
friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty. 
\v 15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, \add and\add* as the
stream of brooks they pass away; 
\v 16 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, \add and\add* wherein the snow
is hid: 
\v 17 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed
out of their place. 
\v 18 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and
perish. 
\v 19 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them. 
\v 20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were
ashamed. 
\v 21 For now ye are no thing; ye see \add my\add* casting down, and are
afraid. 
\v 22 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance? 
\v 23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the
mighty? 
\v 24 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein
I have erred. 
\v 25 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove? 
\v 26 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is
desperate, \add which are\add* as wind? 
\v 27 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig \add a pit\add* for your
friend. 
\v 28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for \add it is\add* evident unto
you if I lie. 
\v 29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my
righteousness \add is\add* in it. 
\v 30 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse
things?
\c 7
\p
\v 1 \add Is there\add* not an appointed time to man upon earth? \add are not
\add* his days also like the days of an hireling? 
\v 2 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh
for \add the reward of\add* his work: 
\v 3 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are
appointed to me. 
\v 4 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I
am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day. 
\v 5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and
become loathsome. 
\v 6 My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.
\v 7 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good. 
\v 8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no \add more:\add* thine
eyes \add are\add* upon me, and I \add am\add* not. 
\v 9 \add As\add* the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth
down to the grave shall come up no \add more. \add*
\v 10 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him
any more. 
\v 11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my
spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. 
\v 12 \add Am\add* I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me? 
\v 13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint; 
\v 14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions: 
\v 15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, \add and\add* death rather than my
life. 
\v 16 I loathe \add it;\add* I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days
\add are\add* vanity. 
\v 17 What \add is\add* man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou
shouldest set thine heart upon him? 
\v 18 And \add that\add* thou shouldest visit him every morning, \add and
\add* try him every moment? 
\v 19 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow
down my spittle? 
\v 20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why
hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself? 
\v 21 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine
iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the
morning, but I \add shall\add* not \add be.\add*
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\v 2 How long wilt thou speak these \add things?\add* and \add how long shall
\add* the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind? 
\v 3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice? 
\v 4 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for
their transgression; 
\v 5 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the
Almighty; 
\v 6 If thou \add wert\add* pure and upright; surely now he would awake for
thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 
\v 7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly
increase. 
\v 8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the
search of their fathers: 
\v 9 (For we \add are but of\add* yesterday, and know nothing, because our
days upon earth \add are\add* a shadow:) 
\v 10 Shall not they teach thee, \add and\add* tell thee, and utter words out
of their heart? 
\v 11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 
\v 12 Whilst it \add is\add* yet in his greenness, \add and\add* not cut down,
it withereth before any \add other\add* herb. 
\v 13 So \add are\add* the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite’s
hope shall perish: 
\v 14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust \add shall be\add* a
spider’s web. 
\v 15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it
fast, but it shall not endure. 
\v 16 He \add is\add* green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in
his garden. 
\v 17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, \add and\add* seeth the place of
stones. 
\v 18 If he destroy him from his place, then \add it\add* shall deny him, 
\add saying,\add* I have not seen thee. 
\v 19 Behold, this \add is\add* the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall
others grow. 
\v 20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect \add man,\add* neither will he
help the evil doers: 
\v 21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. 
\v 22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place
of the wicked shall come to nought.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\v 2 I know \add it is\add* so of a truth: but how should man be just with
God? 
\v 3 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand. 
\v 4 \add He is\add* wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
\add himself\add* against him, and hath prospered? 
\v 5 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them
in his anger. 
\v 6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof
tremble. 
\v 7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars. 
\v 8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the
sea. 
\v 9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the
south. 
\v 10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without
number. 
\v 11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see \add him\add* not: he passeth on also, but
I perceive him not. 
\v 12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What
doest thou? 
\v 13 \add If\add* God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop
under him. 
\v 14 How much less shall I answer him, \add and\add* choose out my words 
\add to reason\add* with him? 
\v 15 Whom, though I were righteous, \add yet\add* would I not answer, 
\add but\add* I would make supplication to my judge. 
\v 16 If I had called, and he had answered me; \add yet\add* would I not
believe that he had hearkened unto my voice. 
\v 17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without
cause. 
\v 18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
bitterness. 
\v 19 If \add I speak\add* of strength, lo, \add he is\add* strong: and if of
judgment, who shall set me a time \add to plead? \add*
\v 20 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: \add if I say, I
am\add* perfect, it shall also prove me perverse. 
\v 21 \add Though\add* I \add were\add* perfect, \add yet\add* would I not
know my soul: I would despise my life. 
\v 22 This \add is\add* one \add thing,\add* therefore I said \add it,
\add* He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 
\v 23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the
innocent. 
\v 24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of
the judges thereof; if not, where, \add and\add* who \add is\add* he? 
\v 25 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good. 
\v 26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle \add that
\add* hasteth to the prey. 
\v 27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and
comfort \add myself: \add*
\v 28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me
innocent. 
\v 29 \add If\add* I be wicked, why then labour I in vain? 
\v 30 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 
\v 31 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor
me. 
\v 32 For \add he is\add* not a man, as I \add am, that\add* I should answer
him, \add and\add* we should come together in judgment. 
\v 33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, \add that\add* might lay his
hand upon us both. 
\v 34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me: 
\v 35 \add Then\add* would I speak, and not fear him; but \add it is
\add* not so with me.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I
will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 
\v 2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest
with me. 
\v 3 \add Is it\add* good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the
wicked? 
\v 4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth? 
\v 5 \add Are\add* thy days as the days of man? \add are\add* thy years as
man’s days, 
\v 6 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin? 
\v 7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and \add there is\add* none that can
deliver out of thine hand. 
\v 8 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou
dost destroy me. 
\v 9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt
thou bring me into dust again? 
\v 10 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese? 
\v 11 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones
and sinews. 
\v 12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved
my spirit. 
\v 13 And these \add things\add* hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that
this \add is\add* with thee. 
\v 14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine
iniquity. 
\v 15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and \add if\add* I be righteous, 
\add yet\add* will I not lift up my head. \add I am\add* full of confusion;
therefore see thou mine affliction; 
\v 16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou
shewest thyself marvellous upon me. 
\v 17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation
upon me; changes and war \add are\add* against me. 
\v 18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had
given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! 
\v 19 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried
from the womb to the grave. 
\v 20 \add Are\add* not my days few? cease \add then, and\add* let me alone,
that I may take comfort a little, 
\v 21 Before I go \add whence\add* I shall not return, \add even\add* to the
land of darkness and the shadow of death; 
\v 22 A land of darkness, as darkness \add itself; and\add* of the shadow of
death, without any order, and \add where\add* the light \add is\add* as
darkness.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
\v 2 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of
talk be justified? 
\v 3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall
no man make thee ashamed? 
\v 4 For thou hast said, My doctrine \add is\add* pure, and I am clean in
thine eyes. 
\v 5 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 
\v 6 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that \add they are
\add* double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee 
\add less\add* than thine iniquity \add deserveth. \add*
\v 7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty
unto perfection? 
\v 8 \add It is\add* as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell;
what canst thou know? 
\v 9 The measure thereof \add is\add* longer than the earth, and broader than
the sea. 
\v 10 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder
him? 
\v 11 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then
consider \add it? \add*
\v 12 For vain man would be wise, though man be born \add like\add* a wild
ass’s colt. 
\v 13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him; 
\v 14 If iniquity \add be\add* in thine hand, put it far away, and let not
wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles. 
\v 15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be
stedfast, and shalt not fear: 
\v 16 Because thou shalt forget \add thy\add* misery, \add and\add* remember 
\add it\add* as waters \add that\add* pass away: 
\v 17 And \add thine\add* age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt
shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning. 
\v 18 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig 
\add about thee, and\add* thou shalt take thy rest in safety. 
\v 19 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make \add thee\add* afraid;
yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 
\v 20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and
their hope \add shall be as\add* the giving up of the ghost.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 And Job answered and said, 
\v 2 No doubt but ye \add are\add* the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
\v 3 But I have understanding as well as you; I \add am\add* not inferior to
you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these? 
\v 4 I am \add as\add* one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and
he answereth him: the just upright \add man is\add* laughed to scorn. 
\v 5 He that is ready to slip with \add his\add* feet \add is as\add* a lamp
despised in the thought of him that is at ease. 
\v 6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure;
into whose hand God bringeth \add abundantly. \add*
\v 7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the
air, and they shall tell thee: 
\v 8 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea
shall declare unto thee. 
\v 9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought
this? 
\v 10 In whose hand \add is\add* the soul of every living thing, and the
breath of all mankind. 
\v 11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat? 
\v 12 With the ancient \add is\add* wisdom; and in length of days
understanding. 
\v 13 With him \add is\add* wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
understanding. 
\v 14 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a
man, and there can be no opening. 
\v 15 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them
out, and they overturn the earth. 
\v 16 With him \add is\add* strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
\add are\add* his. 
\v 17 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools. 
\v 18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. 
\v 19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty. 
\v 20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
understanding of the aged. 
\v 21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the
mighty. 
\v 22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light
the shadow of death. 
\v 23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the
nations, and straiteneth them \add again. \add*
\v 24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and
causeth them to wander in a wilderness \add where there is\add* no way. 
\v 25 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like
\add a\add* drunken \add man.\add*
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Lo, mine eye hath seen all \add this,\add* mine ear hath heard and
understood it. 
\v 2 What ye know, \add the same\add* do I know also: I \add am\add* not
inferior unto you. 
\v 3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. 
\v 4 But ye \add are\add* forgers of lies, ye \add are\add* all physicians of
no value. 
\v 5 Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your
wisdom. 
\v 6 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips. 
\v 7 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him? 
\v 8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God? 
\v 9 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another,
do ye \add so\add* mock him? 
\v 10 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons. 
\v 11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you? 
\v 12 Your remembrances \add are\add* like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies
of clay. 
\v 13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what
\add will. \add*
\v 14 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
\v 15 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own
ways before him. 
\v 16 He also \add shall be\add* my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
before him. 
\v 17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears. 
\v 18 Behold now, I have ordered \add my\add* cause; I know that I shall be
justified. 
\v 19 Who \add is\add* he \add that\add* will plead with me? for now, if I
hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost. 
\v 20 Only do not two \add things\add* unto me: then will I not hide myself
from thee. 
\v 21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid. 
\v 22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
\v 23 How many \add are\add* mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
transgression and my sin. 
\v 24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy? 
\v 25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry
stubble? 
\v 26 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the
iniquities of my youth. 
\v 27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all
my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet. 
\v 28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Man \add that is\add* born of a woman \add is\add* of few days, and full
of trouble. 
\v 2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a
shadow, and continueth not. 
\v 3 And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into
judgment with thee? 
\v 4 Who can bring a clean \add thing\add* out of an unclean? not one. 
\v 5 Seeing his days \add are\add* determined, the number of his months 
\add are\add* with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 
\v 6 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an
hireling, his day. 
\v 7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout
again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. 
\v 8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die
in the ground; 
\v 9 \add Yet\add* through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
boughs like a plant. 
\v 10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where
\add is\add* he? 
\v 11 \add As\add* the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and
drieth up: 
\v 12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens \add be\add* no
more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. 
\v 13 Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me
secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and
remember me! 
\v 14 If a man die, shall he live \add again?\add* all the days of my
appointed time will I wait, till my change come. 
\v 15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the
work of thine hands. 
\v 16 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin? 
\v 17 My transgression \add is\add* sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up
mine iniquity. 
\v 18 And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is
removed out of his place. 
\v 19 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow 
\add out\add* of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man. 
\v 20 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his
countenance, and sendest him away. 
\v 21 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth \add it\add* not; and they are
brought low, but he perceiveth \add it\add* not of them. 
\v 22 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall
mourn.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 
\v 2 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east
wind? 
\v 3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he
can do no good? 
\v 4 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God. 
\v 5 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of
the crafty. 
\v 6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify
against thee. 
\v 7 \add Art\add* thou the first man \add that\add* was born? or wast thou
made before the hills? 
\v 8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to
thyself? 
\v 9 What knowest thou, that we know not? \add what\add* understandest thou,
which \add is\add* not in us? 
\v 10 With us \add are\add* both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder
than thy father. 
\v 11 \add Are\add* the consolations of God small with thee? is there any
secret thing with thee? 
\v 12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at, 
\v 13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest \add such
\add* words go out of thy mouth? 
\v 14 What \add is\add* man, that he should be clean? and \add he which is
\add* born of a woman, that he should be righteous? 
\v 15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not
clean in his sight. 
\v 16 How much more abominable and filthy \add is\add* man, which drinketh
iniquity like water? 
\v 17 I will shew thee, hear me; and that \add which\add* I have seen I will
declare; 
\v 18 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid 
\add it: \add*
\v 19 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
\v 20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all \add his\add* days, and the
number of years is hidden to the oppressor. 
\v 21 A dreadful sound \add is\add* in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
shall come upon him. 
\v 22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited
for of the sword. 
\v 23 He wandereth abroad for bread, \add saying,\add* Where \add is it?
\add* he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand. 
\v 24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against
him, as a king ready to the battle. 
\v 25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself
against the Almighty. 
\v 26 He runneth upon him, \add even\add* on \add his\add* neck, upon the
thick bosses of his bucklers: 
\v 27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat
on \add his\add* flanks. 
\v 28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, \add and\add* in houses which no man
inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps. 
\v 29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither
shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth. 
\v 30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his
branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away. 
\v 31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his
recompence. 
\v 32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be
green. 
\v 33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his
flower as the olive. 
\v 34 For the congregation of hypocrites \add shall be\add* desolate, and fire
shall consume the tabernacles of bribery. 
\v 35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly
prepareth deceit.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\v 2 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters \add are\add* ye
all. 
\v 3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou
answerest? 
\v 4 I also could speak as ye \add do:\add* if your soul were in my soul’s
stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you. 
\v 5 \add But\add* I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my
lips should asswage \add your grief. \add*
\v 6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and \add though\add* I forbear,
what am I eased? 
\v 7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company. 
\v 8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, \add which\add* is a witness 
\add against me:\add* and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my
face. 
\v 9 He teareth \add me\add* in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me. 
\v 10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the
cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me. 
\v 11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands
of the wicked. 
\v 12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken 
\add me\add* by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
\v 13 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and
doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground. 
\v 14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a
giant. 
\v 15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust. 
\v 16 My face is foul with weeping, and my eyelids is the shadow of death; 
\v 17 Not for \add any\add* injustice in mine hands: also my prayer 
\add is\add* pure. 
\v 18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place. 
\v 19 Also now, behold, my witness \add is\add* in heaven, and my record 
\add is\add* on high. 
\v 20 My friends scorn me: \add but\add* mine eye poureth out \add tears
\add* unto God. 
\v 21 Oh that one might plead for a man with God, as a man \add pleadeth
\add* for his neighbour! 
\v 22 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way \add whence
\add* I shall not return.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves \add are ready
\add* for me. 
\v 2 \add Are there\add* not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue
in their provocation? 
\v 3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who \add is\add* he 
\add that\add* will strike hands with me? 
\v 4 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou
not exalt \add them. \add*
\v 5 He that speaketh flattery to \add his\add* friends, even the eyes of his
children shall fail. 
\v 6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a
tabret. 
\v 7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members \add are
\add* as a shadow. 
\v 8 Upright \add men\add* shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall
stir up himself against the hypocrite. 
\v 9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands
shall be stronger and stronger. 
\v 10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find 
\add one\add* wise \add man\add* among you. 
\v 11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, \add even\add* the
thoughts of my heart. 
\v 12 They change the night into day: the light \add is\add* short because of
darkness. 
\v 13 If I wait, the grave \add is\add* mine house: I have made my bed in the
darkness. 
\v 14 I have said to corruption, Thou \add art\add* my father: to the worm, 
\add Thou art\add* my mother, and my sister. 
\v 15 And where \add is\add* now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it? 
\v 16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when \add our\add* rest
together \add is\add* in the dust.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\v 2 How long \add will it be ere\add* ye make an end of words? mark, and
afterwards we will speak. 
\v 3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, \add and\add* reputed vile in your
sight? 
\v 4 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee?
and shall the rock be removed out of his place? 
\v 5 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire
shall not shine. 
\v 6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put
out with him. 
\v 7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall
cast him down. 
\v 8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare. 
\v 9 The gin shall take \add him\add* by the heel, \add and\add* the robber
shall prevail against him. 
\v 10 The snare \add is\add* laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
the way. 
\v 11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his
feet. 
\v 12 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction \add shall be
\add* ready at his side. 
\v 13 It shall devour the strength of his skin: \add even\add* the firstborn
of death shall devour his strength. 
\v 14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring
him to the king of terrors. 
\v 15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because \add it is\add* none of his:
brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 
\v 16 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut
off. 
\v 17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name
in the street. 
\v 18 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the
world. 
\v 19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining
in his dwellings. 
\v 20 They that come after \add him\add* shall be astonied at his day, as they
that went before were affrighted. 
\v 21 Surely such \add are\add* the dwellings of the wicked, and this 
\add is\add* the place \add of him that\add* knoweth not God.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\v 2 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words? 
\v 3 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed \add that
\add* ye make yourselves strange to me. 
\v 4 And be it indeed \add that\add* I have erred, mine error remaineth with
myself. 
\v 5 If indeed ye will magnify \add yourselves\add* against me, and plead
against me my reproach: 
\v 6 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his
net. 
\v 7 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but 
\add there is\add* no judgment. 
\v 8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in
my paths. 
\v 9 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown \add from
\add* my head. 
\v 10 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he
removed like a tree. 
\v 11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him
as \add one of\add* his enemies. 
\v 12 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp
round about my tabernacle. 
\v 13 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily
estranged from me. 
\v 14 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me. 
\v 15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I
am an alien in their sight. 
\v 16 I called my servant, and he gave \add me\add* no answer; I intreated him
with my mouth. 
\v 17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children’s 
\add sake\add* of mine own body. 
\v 18 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me. 
\v 19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned
against me. 
\v 20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the
skin of my teeth. 
\v 21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of
God hath touched me. 
\v 22 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh? 
\v 23 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
\v 24 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever! 
\v 25 For I know \add that\add* my redeemer liveth, and \add that\add* he
shall stand at the latter \add day\add* upon the earth: 
\v 26 And \add though\add* after my skin \add worms\add* destroy this 
\add body,\add* yet in my flesh shall I see God: 
\v 27 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not
another; \add though\add* my reins be consumed within me. 
\v 28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter
is found in me? 
\v 29 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath \add bringeth\add* the punishments
of the sword, that ye may know \add there is\add* a judgment.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
\v 2 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for \add this
\add* I make haste. 
\v 3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding
causeth me to answer. 
\v 4 Knowest thou \add not\add* this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
\v 5 That the triumphing of the wicked \add is\add* short, and the joy of the
hypocrite \add but\add* for a moment? 
\v 6 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto
the clouds; 
\v 7 \add Yet\add* he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have
seen him shall say, Where \add is\add* he? 
\v 8 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be
chased away as a vision of the night. 
\v 9 The eye also \add which\add* saw him shall \add see him\add* no more;
neither shall his place any more behold him. 
\v 10 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore
their goods. 
\v 11 His bones are full \add of the sin\add* of his youth, which shall lie
down with him in the dust. 
\v 12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, \add though\add* he hide it
under his tongue; 
\v 13 \add Though\add* he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still
within his mouth: 
\v 14 \add Yet\add* his meat in his bowels is turned, \add it is\add* the gall
of asps within him. 
\v 15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God
shall cast them out of his belly. 
\v 16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him. 
\v 17 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and
butter. 
\v 18 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow 
\add it\add* down: according to \add his\add* substance \add shall\add* the
restitution \add be,\add* and he shall not rejoice \add therein. \add*
\v 19 Because he hath oppressed \add and\add* hath forsaken the poor; 
\add because\add* he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
\v 20 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of
that which he desired. 
\v 21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for
his goods. 
\v 22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of
the wicked shall come upon him. 
\v 23 \add When\add* he is about to fill his belly, \add God\add* shall cast
the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain \add it\add* upon him while he
is eating. 
\v 24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, \add and\add* the bow of steel shall
strike him through. 
\v 25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword
cometh out of his gall: terrors \add are\add* upon him. 
\v 26 All darkness \add shall be\add* hid in his secret places: a fire not
blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his
tabernacle. 
\v 27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up
against him. 
\v 28 The increase of his house shall depart, \add and his goods\add* shall
flow away in the day of his wrath. 
\v 29 This \add is\add* the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
appointed unto him by God.

\p
\v 1 But Job answered and said, 
\v 2 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. 
\v 3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. 
\v 4 As for me, \add is\add* my complaint to man? and if \add it were so,
\add* why should not my spirit be troubled? 
\v 5 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay \add your\add* hand upon \add your
\add* mouth. 
\v 6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
\v 7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power? 
\v 8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring
before their eyes. 
\v 9 Their houses \add are\add* safe from fear, neither \add is\add* the rod
of God upon them. 
\v 10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth
not her calf. 
\v 11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children
dance. 
\v 12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. 
\v 13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave. 
\v 14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the
knowledge of thy ways. 
\v 15 What \add is\add* the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what
profit should we have, if we pray unto him? 
\v 16 Lo, their good \add is\add* not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked
is far from me. 
\v 17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and \add how oft
\add* cometh their destruction upon them! \add God\add* distributeth sorrows
in his anger. 
\v 18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm
carrieth away. 
\v 19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he
shall know \add it. \add*
\v 20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of
the Almighty. 
\v 21 For what pleasure \add hath\add* he in his house after him, when the
number of his months is cut off in the midst? 
\v 22 Shall \add any\add* teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that
are high. 
\v 23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. 
\v 24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. 
\v 25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with
pleasure. 
\v 26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. 
\v 27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices \add which\add* ye
wrongfully imagine against me. 
\v 28 For ye say, Where \add is\add* the house of the prince? and where 
\add are\add* the dwelling places of the wicked? 
\v 29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their
tokens, 
\v 30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be
brought forth to the day of wrath. 
\v 31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him 
\add what\add* he hath done? 
\v 32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. 
\v 33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall
draw after him, as \add there are\add* innumerable before him. 
\v 34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth
falsehood?
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
\v 2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable
unto himself? 
\v 3 \add Is it\add* any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or
\add is it\add* gain \add to him\add* that thou makest thy ways perfect? 
\v 4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into
judgment? 
\v 5 \add Is\add* not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite? 
\v 6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped
the naked of their clothing. 
\v 7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden
bread from the hungry. 
\v 8 But \add as for\add* the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable
man dwelt in it. 
\v 9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have
been broken. 
\v 10 Therefore snares \add are\add* round about thee, and sudden fear
troubleth thee; 
\v 11 Or darkness, \add that\add* thou canst not see; and abundance of waters
cover thee. 
\v 12 \add Is\add* not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of
the stars, how high they are! 
\v 13 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark
cloud? 
\v 14 Thick clouds \add are\add* a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he
walketh in the circuit of heaven. 
\v 15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden? 
\v 16 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a
flood: 
\v 17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for
them? 
\v 18 Yet he filled their houses with good \add things:\add* but the counsel
of the wicked is far from me. 
\v 19 The righteous see \add it,\add* and are glad: and the innocent laugh
them to scorn. 
\v 20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire
consumeth. 
\v 21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come
unto thee. 
\v 22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in
thine heart. 
\v 23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put
away iniquity far from thy tabernacles. 
\v 24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the \add gold\add* of Ophir as
the stones of the brooks. 
\v 25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of
silver. 
\v 26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up
thy face unto God. 
\v 27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou
shalt pay thy vows. 
\v 28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee:
and the light shall shine upon thy ways. 
\v 29 When \add men\add* are cast down, then thou shalt say, \add There is
\add* lifting up; and he shall save the humble person. 
\v 30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the
pureness of thine hands.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered and said, 
\v 2 Even to day \add is\add* my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than
my groaning. 
\v 3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! \add that\add* I might come 
\add even\add* to his seat! 
\v 4 I would order \add my\add* cause before him, and fill my mouth with
arguments. 
\v 5 I would know the words \add which\add* he would answer me, and understand
what he would say unto me. 
\v 6 Will he plead against me with \add his\add* great power? No; but he would
put \add strength\add* in me. 
\v 7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for
ever from my judge. 
\v 8 Behold, I go forward, but he \add is\add* not \add there;\add* and
backward, but I cannot perceive him: 
\v 9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold \add him:
\add* he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see \add him: 
\add*
\v 10 But he knoweth the way that I take: \add when\add* he hath tried me, I
shall come forth as gold. 
\v 11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined. 
\v 12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have
esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary \add food. \add*
\v 13 But he \add is\add* in one \add mind,\add* and who can turn him? and 
\add what\add* his soul desireth, even \add that\add* he doeth. 
\v 14 For he performeth \add the thing that is\add* appointed for me: and many
such \add things are\add* with him. 
\v 15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of
him. 
\v 16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 
\v 17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, \add neither\add* hath he
covered the darkness from my face.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him
not see his days? 
\v 2 \add Some\add* remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and
feed \add thereof. \add*
\v 3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a
pledge. 
\v 4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves
together. 
\v 5 Behold, \add as\add* wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their
work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness \add yieldeth\add* food for
them \add and\add* for \add their\add* children. 
\v 6 They reap \add every one\add* his corn in the field: and they gather the
vintage of the wicked. 
\v 7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that \add they have
\add* no covering in the cold. 
\v 8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for
want of a shelter. 
\v 9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the
poor. 
\v 10 They cause \add him\add* to go naked without clothing, and they take
away the sheaf \add from\add* the hungry; 
\v 11 \add Which\add* make oil within their walls, \add and\add* tread 
\add their\add* winepresses, and suffer thirst. 
\v 12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out:
yet God layeth not folly \add to them. \add*
\v 13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways
thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof. 
\v 14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in
the night is as a thief. 
\v 15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye
shall see me: and disguiseth \add his\add* face. 
\v 16 In the dark they dig through houses, \add which\add* they had marked for
themselves in the daytime: they know not the light. 
\v 17 For the morning \add is\add* to them even as the shadow of death: if 
\add one\add* know \add them, they are in\add* the terrors of the shadow of
death. 
\v 18 He \add is\add* swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the
earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards. 
\v 19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: \add so doth\add* the grave 
\add those which\add* have sinned. 
\v 20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall
be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree. 
\v 21 He evil entreateth the barren that \add beareth\add* not: and doeth not
good to the widow. 
\v 22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no 
\add man\add* is sure of life. 
\v 23 \add Though\add* it be given him \add to be\add* in safety, whereon he
resteth; yet his eyes \add are\add* upon their ways. 
\v 24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they
are taken out of the way as all \add other,\add* and cut off as the tops of
the ears of corn. 
\v 25 And if \add it be\add* not \add so\add* now, who will make me a liar,
and make my speech nothing worth?
\c 25
\p
\v 1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
\v 2 Dominion and fear \add are\add* with him, he maketh peace in his high
places. 
\v 3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his light
arise? 
\v 4 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean 
\add that is\add* born of a woman? 
\v 5 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure
in his sight. 
\v 6 How much less man, \add that is\add* a worm? and the son of man, 
\add which is\add* a worm?
\c 26
\p
\v 1 But Job answered and said, 
\v 2 How hast thou helped \add him that is\add* without power? \add how
\add* savest thou the arm \add that hath\add* no strength? 
\v 3 How hast thou counseled \add him that hath\add* no wisdom? and 
\add how\add* hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is? 
\v 4 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee? 
\v 5 Dead \add things\add* are formed from under the waters, and the
inhabitants thereof. 
\v 6 Hell \add is\add* naked before him, and destruction hath no covering. 
\v 7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, \add and\add* hangeth
the earth upon nothing. 
\v 8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent
under them. 
\v 9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, \add and\add* spreadeth his cloud
upon it. 
\v 10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come
to an end. 
\v 11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof. 
\v 12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth
through the proud. 
\v 13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the
crooked serpent. 
\v 14 Lo, these \add are\add* parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
\c 27
\p
\v 1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
\v 2 \add As\add* God liveth, \add who\add* hath taken away my judgment; and
the Almighty, \add who\add* hath vexed my soul; 
\v 3 All the while my breath \add is\add* in me, and the spirit of God 
\add is\add* in my nostrils; 
\v 4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit. 
\v 5 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine
integrity from me. 
\v 6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not
reproach \add me\add* so long as I live. 
\v 7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the
unrighteous. 
\v 8 For what \add is\add* the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
when God taketh away his soul? 
\v 9 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? 
\v 10 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God? 
\v 11 I will teach you by the hand of God: \add that\add* which \add is
\add* with the Almighty will I not conceal. 
\v 12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen \add it;\add* why then are ye thus
altogether vain? 
\v 13 This \add is\add* the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage
of oppressors, \add which\add* they shall receive of the Almighty. 
\v 14 If his children be multiplied, \add it is\add* for the sword: and his
offspring shall not be satisfied with bread. 
\v 15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall
not weep. 
\v 16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay; 
\v 17 He may prepare \add it,\add* but the just shall put \add it\add* on, and
the innocent shall divide the silver. 
\v 18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth \add that\add* the
keeper maketh. 
\v 19 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth
his eyes, and he \add is\add* not. 
\v 20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the
night. 
\v 21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm
hurleth him out of his place. 
\v 22 For \add God\add* shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee
out of his hand. 
\v 23 \add Men\add* shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of
his place.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold \add where
\add* they fine \add it. \add*
\v 2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass \add is\add* molten \add out
of\add* the stone. 
\v 3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the
stones of darkness, and the shadow of death. 
\v 4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; \add even the waters
\add* forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men. 
\v 5 \add As for\add* the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is
turned up as it were fire. 
\v 6 The stones of it \add are\add* the place of sapphires: and it hath dust
of gold. 
\v 7 \add There is\add* a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s
eye hath not seen: 
\v 8 The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
\v 9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by
the roots. 
\v 10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious
thing. 
\v 11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and \add the thing that is
\add* hid bringeth he forth to light. 
\v 12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where \add is\add* the place of
understanding? 
\v 13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of
the living. 
\v 14 The depth saith, It \add is\add* not in me: and the sea saith, 
\add It is\add* not with me. 
\v 15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed 
\add for\add* the price thereof. 
\v 16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or
the sapphire. 
\v 17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it 
\add shall not be for\add* jewels of fine gold. 
\v 18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom
\add is\add* above rubies. 
\v 19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued
with pure gold. 
\v 20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where \add is\add* the place of
understanding? 
\v 21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the
fowls of the air. 
\v 22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our
ears. 
\v 23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 
\v 24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, \add and\add* seeth under the
whole heaven; 
\v 25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by
measure. 
\v 26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the
thunder: 
\v 27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it
out. 
\v 28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that \add is
\add* wisdom; and to depart from evil \add is\add* understanding.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
\v 2 Oh that I were as \add in\add* months past, as \add in\add* the days 
\add when\add* God preserved me; 
\v 3 When his candle shined upon my head, \add and when\add* by his light I
walked \add through\add* darkness; 
\v 4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God \add was
\add* upon my tabernacle; 
\v 5 When the Almighty \add was\add* yet with me, \add when\add* my children 
\add were\add* about me; 
\v 6 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of
oil; 
\v 7 When I went out to the gate through the city, \add when\add* I prepared
my seat in the street! 
\v 8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, \add and
\add* stood up. 
\v 9 The princes refrained talking, and laid \add their\add* hand on their
mouth. 
\v 10 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of
their mouth. 
\v 11 When the ear heard \add me,\add* then it blessed me; and when the eye
saw \add me,\add* it gave witness to me: 
\v 12 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and 
\add him that had\add* none to help him. 
\v 13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused
the widow’s heart to sing for joy. 
\v 14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment \add was
\add* as a robe and a diadem. 
\v 15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet \add was\add* I to the lame. 
\v 16 I \add was\add* a father to the poor: and the cause \add which
\add* I knew not I searched out. 
\v 17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his
teeth. 
\v 18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply \add my
\add* days as the sand. 
\v 19 My root \add was\add* spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all
night upon my branch. 
\v 20 My glory \add was\add* fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand. 
\v 21 Unto me \add men\add* gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
counsel. 
\v 22 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them. 
\v 23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide
\add as\add* for the latter rain. 
\v 24 \add If\add* I laughed on them, they believed \add it\add* not; and the
light of my countenance they cast not down. 
\v 25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army,
as one \add that\add* comforteth the mourners.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 But now \add they that are\add* younger than I have me in derision, whose
fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock. 
\v 2 Yea, whereto \add might\add* the strength of their hands \add profit
\add* me, in whom old age was perished? 
\v 3 For want and famine \add they were\add* solitary; fleeing into the
wilderness in former time desolate and waste. 
\v 4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots \add for\add* their
meat. 
\v 5 They were driven forth from among \add men,\add* (they cried after them
as \add after\add* a thief;) 
\v 6 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, \add in\add* caves of the earth,
and \add in\add* the rocks. 
\v 7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered
together. 
\v 8 \add They were\add* children of fools, yea, children of base men: they
were viler than the earth. 
\v 9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword. 
\v 10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
\v 11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let
loose the bridle before me. 
\v 12 Upon \add my\add* right \add hand\add* rise the youth; they push away my
feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction. 
\v 13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper. 
\v 14 They came \add upon me\add* as a wide breaking in \add of waters:
\add* in the desolation they rolled themselves \add upon me. \add*
\v 15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my
welfare passeth away as a cloud. 
\v 16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken
hold upon me. 
\v 17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no
rest. 
\v 18 By the great force \add of my disease\add* is my garment changed: it
bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. 
\v 19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. 
\v 20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou
regardest me \add not. \add*
\v 21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself
against me. 
\v 22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride \add upon it,
\add* and dissolvest my substance. 
\v 23 For I know \add that\add* thou wilt bring me \add to\add* death, and 
\add to\add* the house appointed for all living. 
\v 24 Howbeit he will not stretch out \add his\add* hand to the grave, though
they cry in his destruction. 
\v 25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was \add not\add* my soul
grieved for the poor? 
\v 26 When I looked for good, then evil came \add unto me:\add* and when I
waited for light, there came darkness. 
\v 27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me. 
\v 28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, \add and\add* I cried in
the congregation. 
\v 29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. 
\v 30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat. 
\v 31 My harp also is \add turned\add* to mourning, and my organ into the
voice of them that weep.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid? 
\v 2 For what portion of God \add is there\add* from above? and \add what
\add* inheritance of the Almighty from on high? 
\v 3 \add Is\add* not destruction to the wicked? and a strange \add punishment
\add* to the workers of iniquity? 
\v 4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps? 
\v 5 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 
\v 6 Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity. 
\v 7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine
eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 
\v 8 \add Then\add* let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be
rooted out. 
\v 9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or \add if\add* I have laid
wait at my neighbour’s door; 
\v 10 \add Then\add* let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down
upon her. 
\v 11 For this \add is\add* an heinous crime; yea, it \add is\add* an iniquity
\add to be punished by\add* the judges. 
\v 12 For it \add is\add* a fire \add that\add* consumeth to destruction, and
would root out all mine increase. 
\v 13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when
they contended with me; 
\v 14 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what
shall I answer him? 
\v 15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us
in the womb? 
\v 16 If I have withheld the poor from \add their\add* desire, or have caused
the eyes of the widow to fail; 
\v 17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten
thereof; 
\v 18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as \add with\add* a
father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;) 
\v 19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without
covering; 
\v 20 If his loins have not blessed me, and \add if\add* he were \add not
\add* warmed with the fleece of my sheep; 
\v 21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help
in the gate: 
\v 22 \add Then\add* let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be
broken from the bone. 
\v 23 For destruction \add from\add* God \add was\add* a terror to me, and by
reason of his highness I could not endure. 
\v 24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, \add Thou
art\add* my confidence; 
\v 25 If I rejoiced because my wealth \add was\add* great, and because mine
hand had gotten much; 
\v 26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking \add in
\add* brightness; 
\v 27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my
hand: 
\v 28 This also \add were\add* an iniquity \add to be punished by\add* the
judge: for I should have denied the God \add that is\add* above. 
\v 29 If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up
myself when evil found him: 
\v 30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
\v 31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we
cannot be satisfied. 
\v 32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: \add but\add* I opened my
doors to the traveller. 
\v 33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my
bosom: 
\v 34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify
me, that I kept silence, \add and\add* went not out of the door? 
\v 35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire \add is, that\add* the
Almighty would answer me, and \add that\add* mine adversary had written a
book. 
\v 36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, \add and\add* bind it 
\add as\add* a crown to me. 
\v 37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go
near unto him. 
\v 38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof
complain; 
\v 39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the
owners thereof to lose their life: 
\v 40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The
words of Job are ended.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he \add was\add*
righteous in his own eyes. 
\v 2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of
the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified
himself rather than God. 
\v 3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had
found no answer, and yet had condemned Job. 
\v 4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than
he. 
\v 5 When Elihu saw that \add there was\add* no answer in the mouth of 
\add these\add* three men, then his wrath was kindled. 
\v 6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I \add am
\add* young, and ye \add are\add* very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst
not shew you mine opinion. 
\v 7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom. 
\v 8 But \add there is\add* a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
Almighty giveth them understanding. 
\v 9 Great men are not \add always\add* wise: neither do the aged understand
judgment. 
\v 10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion. 
\v 11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye
searched out what to say. 
\v 12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, \add there was\add* none of you
that convinced Job, or that answered his words: 
\v 13 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down,
not man. 
\v 14 Now he hath not directed \add his\add* words against me: neither will I
answer him with your speeches. 
\v 15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking. 
\v 16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, \add and
\add* answered no more;) 
\v 17 \add I said,\add* I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine
opinion. 
\v 18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me. 
\v 19 Behold, my belly \add is\add* as wine \add which\add* hath no vent; it
is ready to burst like new bottles. 
\v 20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer. 
\v 21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person, neither let me give
flattering titles unto man. 
\v 22 For I know not to give flattering titles; \add in so doing\add* my maker
would soon take me away.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my
words. 
\v 2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 
\v 3 My words \add shall be of\add* the uprightness of my heart: and my lips
shall utter knowledge clearly. 
\v 4 The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given
me life. 
\v 5 If thou canst answer me, set \add thy words\add* in order before me,
stand up. 
\v 6 Behold, I \add am\add* according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am
formed out of the clay. 
\v 7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be
heavy upon thee. 
\v 8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of 
\add thy\add* words, \add saying, \add*
\v 9 I am clean without transgression, I \add am\add* innocent; neither 
\add is there\add* iniquity in me. 
\v 10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy, 
\v 11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths. 
\v 12 Behold, \add in\add* this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that
God is greater than man. 
\v 13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of
his matters. 
\v 14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, \add yet man\add* perceiveth it not. 
\v 15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men,
in slumberings upon the bed; 
\v 16 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction, 
\v 17 That he may withdraw man \add from his\add* purpose, and hide pride from
man. 
\v 18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by
the sword. 
\v 19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his
bones with strong \add pain: \add*
\v 20 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat. 
\v 21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones 
\add that\add* were not seen stick out. 
\v 22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
destroyers. 
\v 23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand,
to shew unto man his uprightness: 
\v 24 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to
the pit: I have found a ransom. 
\v 25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days
of his youth: 
\v 26 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall
see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. 
\v 27 He looketh upon men, and \add if any\add* say, I have sinned, and
perverted \add that which was\add* right, and it profited me not; 
\v 28 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see
the light. 
\v 29 Lo, all these \add things\add* worketh God oftentimes with man, 
\v 30 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of
the living. 
\v 31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak. 
\v 32 If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify
thee. 
\v 33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
\c 34
\p
\v 1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 
\v 2 Hear my words, O ye wise \add men;\add* and give ear unto me, ye that
have knowledge. 
\v 3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat. 
\v 4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what 
\add is\add* good. 
\v 5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment. 
\v 6 Should I lie against my right? my wound \add is\add* incurable without
transgression. 
\v 7 What man \add is\add* like Job, \add who\add* drinketh up scorning like
water? 
\v 8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with
wicked men. 
\v 9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight
himself with God. 
\v 10 Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God,
\add that he should do\add* wickedness; and \add from\add* the Almighty, 
\add that he should commit\add* iniquity. 
\v 11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to
find according to \add his\add* ways. 
\v 12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert
judgment. 
\v 13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the
whole world? 
\v 14 If he set his heart upon man, \add if\add* he gather unto himself his
spirit and his breath; 
\v 15 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust. 
\v 16 If now \add thou hast\add* understanding, hear this: hearken to the
voice of my words. 
\v 17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that
is most just? 
\v 18 \add Is it fit\add* to say to a king, \add Thou art\add* wicked? 
\add and\add* to princes, \add Ye are\add* ungodly? 
\v 19 \add How much less to him\add* that accepteth not the persons of
princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all \add are
\add* the work of his hands. 
\v 20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at
midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand. 
\v 21 For his eyes \add are\add* upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
goings. 
\v 22 \add There is\add* no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers
of iniquity may hide themselves. 
\v 23 For he will not lay upon man more \add than right;\add* that he should
enter into judgment with God. 
\v 24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in
their stead. 
\v 25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth \add them
\add* in the night, so that they are destroyed. 
\v 26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others; 
\v 27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his
ways: 
\v 28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth
the cry of the afflicted. 
\v 29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth
\add his\add* face, who then can behold him? whether \add it be done
\add* against a nation, or against a man only: 
\v 30 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared. 
\v 31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne \add chastisement,
\add* I will not offend \add any more: \add*
\v 32 \add That which\add* I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I
will do no more. 
\v 33 \add Should it be\add* according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what
thou knowest. 
\v 34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. 
\v 35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words \add were\add* without
wisdom. 
\v 36 My desire \add is that\add* Job may be tried unto the end because of 
\add his\add* answers for wicked men. 
\v 37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth \add his hands
\add* among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
\c 35
\p
\v 1 Elihu spake moreover, and said, 
\v 2 Thinkest thou this to be right, \add that\add* thou saidst, My
righteousness \add is\add* more than God’s? 
\v 3 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? \add and,
\add* What profit shall I have, \add if I be cleansed\add* from my sin? 
\v 4 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee. 
\v 5 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds \add which
\add* are higher than thou. 
\v 6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or \add if\add* thy
transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him? 
\v 7 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine
hand? 
\v 8 Thy wickedness \add may hurt\add* a man as thou \add art;\add* and thy
righteousness \add may profit\add* the son of man. 
\v 9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make \add the oppressed
\add* to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty. 
\v 10 But none saith, Where \add is\add* God my maker, who giveth songs in the
night; 
\v 11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser
than the fowls of heaven? 
\v 12 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil
men. 
\v 13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. 
\v 14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, \add yet\add* judgment 
\add is\add* before him; therefore trust thou in him. 
\v 15 But now, because \add it is\add* not \add so,\add* he hath visited in
his anger; yet he knoweth \add it\add* not in great extremity: 
\v 16 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without
knowledge.
\c 36
\p
\v 1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 
\v 2 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that \add I have\add* yet to
speak on God’s behalf. 
\v 3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my
Maker. 
\v 4 For truly my words \add shall\add* not \add be\add* false: he that is
perfect in knowledge \add is\add* with thee. 
\v 5 Behold, God \add is\add* mighty, and despiseth not \add any: he is
\add* mighty in strength \add and\add* wisdom. 
\v 6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor. 
\v 7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings 
\add are they\add* on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and
they are exalted. 
\v 8 And if \add they be\add* bound in fetters, \add and\add* be holden in
cords of affliction; 
\v 9 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have
exceeded. 
\v 10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return
from iniquity. 
\v 11 If they obey and serve \add him,\add* they shall spend their days in
prosperity, and their years in pleasures. 
\v 12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die
without knowledge. 
\v 13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth
them. 
\v 14 They die in youth, and their life \add is\add* among the unclean. 
\v 15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in
oppression. 
\v 16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait \add into
\add* a broad place, where \add there is\add* no straitness; and that which 
\add should be\add* set on thy table should be full of fatness. 
\v 17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice
take hold \add on thee. \add*
\v 18 Because \add there is\add* wrath, \add beware\add* lest he take thee
away with \add his\add* stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee. 
\v 19 Will he esteem thy riches? \add no,\add* not gold, nor all the forces of
strength. 
\v 20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place. 
\v 21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than
affliction. 
\v 22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him? 
\v 23 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought
iniquity? 
\v 24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. 
\v 25 Every man may see it; man may behold \add it\add* afar off. 
\v 26 Behold, God \add is\add* great, and we know \add him\add* not, neither
can the number of his years be searched out. 
\v 27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to
the vapour thereof: 
\v 28 Which the clouds do drop \add and\add* distil upon man abundantly. 
\v 29 Also can \add any\add* understand the spreadings of the clouds, 
\add or\add* the noise of his tabernacle? 
\v 30 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the
sea. 
\v 31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance. 
\v 32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it \add not to shine
\add* by \add the cloud\add* that cometh betwixt. 
\v 33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the
vapour.
\c 37
\p
\v 1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place. 
\v 2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound \add that
\add* goeth out of his mouth. 
\v 3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends
of the earth. 
\v 4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency;
and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. 
\v 5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which
we cannot comprehend. 
\v 6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou \add on\add* the earth; likewise to the
small rain, and to the great rain of his strength. 
\v 7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work. 
\v 8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places. 
\v 9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north. 
\v 10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is
straitened. 
\v 11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright
cloud: 
\v 12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do
whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth. 
\v 13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for
mercy. 
\v 14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works
of God. 
\v 15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud
to shine? 
\v 16 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him
which is perfect in knowledge? 
\v 17 How thy garments \add are\add* warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
south \add wind? \add*
\v 18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, \add which is\add* strong, 
\add and\add* as a molten looking glass? 
\v 19 Teach us what we shall say unto him; \add for\add* we cannot order 
\add our speech\add* by reason of darkness. 
\v 20 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be
swallowed up. 
\v 21 And now \add men\add* see not the bright light which is in the clouds:
but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them. 
\v 22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty. 
\v 23 \add Touching\add* the Almighty, we cannot find him out: \add he is
\add* excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will
not afflict. 
\v 24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any \add that are
\add* wise of heart.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
\v 2 Who \add is\add* this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
\v 3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer
thou me. 
\v 4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if
thou hast understanding. 
\v 5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath
stretched the line upon it? 
\v 6 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner
stone thereof; 
\v 7 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for
joy? 
\v 8 Or \add who\add* shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, 
\add as if\add* it had issued out of the womb? 
\v 9 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a
swaddlingband for it, 
\v 10 And brake up for it my decreed \add place,\add* and set bars and doors,
\v 11 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy
proud waves be stayed? 
\v 12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; \add and\add* caused the
dayspring to know his place; 
\v 13 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might
be shaken out of it? 
\v 14 It is turned as clay \add to\add* the seal; and they stand as a
garment. 
\v 15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be
broken. 
\v 16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in
the search of the depth? 
\v 17 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the
doors of the shadow of death? 
\v 18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it
all. 
\v 19 Where \add is\add* the way \add where\add* light dwelleth? and 
\add as for\add* darkness, where \add is\add* the place thereof, 
\v 20 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou
shouldest know the paths \add to\add* the house thereof? 
\v 21 Knowest thou \add it,\add* because thou wast then born? or \add because
\add* the number of thy days \add is\add* great? 
\v 22 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the
treasures of the hail, 
\v 23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of
battle and war? 
\v 24 By what way is the light parted, \add which\add* scattereth the east
wind upon the earth? 
\v 25 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way
for the lightning of thunder; 
\v 26 To cause it to rain on the earth, \add where\add* no man \add is; on
\add* the wilderness, wherein \add there is\add* no man; 
\v 27 To satisfy the desolate and waste \add ground;\add* and to cause the bud
of the tender herb to spring forth? 
\v 28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 
\v 29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath
gendered it? 
\v 30 The waters are hid as \add with\add* a stone, and the face of the deep
is frozen. 
\v 31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of
Orion? 
\v 32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide
Arcturus with his sons? 
\v 33 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion
thereof in the earth? 
\v 34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may
cover thee? 
\v 35 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we
\add are? \add*
\v 36 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding
to the heart? 
\v 37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of
heaven, 
\v 38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast
together? 
\v 39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young
lions, 
\v 40 When they couch in \add their\add* dens, \add and\add* abide in the
covert to lie in wait? 
\v 41 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God,
they wander for lack of meat.

\p
\v 1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? 
\add or\add* canst thou mark when the hinds do calve? 
\v 2 Canst thou number the months \add that\add* they fulfil? or knowest thou
the time when they bring forth? 
\v 3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out
their sorrows. 
\v 4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go
forth, and return not unto them. 
\v 5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the
wild ass? 
\v 6 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his
dwellings. 
\v 7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of
the driver. 
\v 8 The range of the mountains \add is\add* his pasture, and he searcheth
after every green thing. 
\v 9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib? 
\v 10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he
harrow the valleys after thee? 
\v 11 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength \add is\add* great? or wilt
thou leave thy labour to him? 
\v 12 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather 
\add it into\add* thy barn? 
\v 13 \add Gavest thou\add* the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and
feathers unto the ostrich? 
\v 14 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 
\v 15 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may
break them. 
\v 16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though \add they were
\add* not hers: her labour is in vain without fear; 
\v 17 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her
understanding. 
\v 18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his
rider. 
\v 19 Hath thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with
thunder? 
\v 20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils 
\add is\add* terrible. 
\v 21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in \add his\add* strength: he
goeth on to meet the armed men. 
\v 22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from
the sword. 
\v 23 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield. 
\v 24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he
that \add it is\add* the sound of the trumpet. 
\v 25 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar
off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. 
\v 26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, \add and\add* stretch her wings toward
the south? 
\v 27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high? 
\v 28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the
strong place. 
\v 29 From thence she seeketh the prey, \add and\add* her eyes behold afar
off. 
\v 30 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain \add are,
\add* there \add is\add* she.

\p
\v 1 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 
\v 2 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct \add him?\add* he
that reproveth God, let him answer it.
\p
\v 3 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 
\v 4 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my
mouth. 
\v 5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed
no further.
\p
\v 6 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
\v 7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou
unto me. 
\v 8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou
mayest be righteous? 
\v 9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him? 
\v 10 Deck thyself now \add with\add* majesty and excellency; and array
thyself with glory and beauty. 
\v 11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one \add that is
\add* proud, and abase him. 
\v 12 Look on every one \add that is\add* proud, \add and\add* bring him low;
and tread down the wicked in their place. 
\v 13 Hide them in the dust together; \add and\add* bind their faces in
secret. 
\v 14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save
thee.
\p
\v 15 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox. 
\v 16 Lo now, his strength \add is\add* in his loins, and his force 
\add is\add* in the navel of his belly. 
\v 17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped
together. 
\v 18 His bones \add are as\add* strong pieces of brass; his bones \add are
\add* like bars of iron. 
\v 19 He \add is\add* the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make
his sword to approach \add unto him. \add*
\v 20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the
field play. 
\v 21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens. 
\v 22 The shady trees cover him \add with\add* their shadow; the willows of
the brook compass him about. 
\v 23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, \add and\add* hasteth not: he trusteth
that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 
\v 24 He taketh it with his eyes: \add his\add* nose pierceth through snares.
\c 41
\p
\v 1 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord 
\add which\add* thou lettest down? 
\v 2 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a
thorn? 
\v 3 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft \add words
\add* unto thee? 
\v 4 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for
ever? 
\v 5 Wilt thou play with him as \add with\add* a bird? or wilt thou bind him
for thy maidens? 
\v 6 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the
merchants? 
\v 7 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish
spears? 
\v 8 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. 
\v 9 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not \add one\add* be cast down
even at the sight of him? 
\v 10 None \add is so\add* fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to
stand before me? 
\v 11 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay \add him? whatsoever is
\add* under the whole heaven is mine. 
\v 12 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
\v 13 Who can discover the face of his garment? \add or\add* who can come 
\add to him\add* with his double bridle? 
\v 14 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth \add are\add* terrible
round about. 
\v 15 \add His\add* scales \add are his\add* pride, shut up together 
\add as with\add* a close seal. 
\v 16 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 
\v 17 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be
sundered. 
\v 18 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes \add are\add* like the
eyelids of the morning. 
\v 19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, \add and\add* sparks of fire leap
out. 
\v 20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as \add out\add* of a seething pot or
caldron. 
\v 21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 
\v 22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before
him. 
\v 23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in
themselves; they cannot be moved. 
\v 24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether 
\add millstone. \add*
\v 25 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of
breakings they purify themselves. 
\v 26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart,
nor the habergeon. 
\v 27 He esteemeth iron as straw, \add and\add* brass as rotten wood. 
\v 28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into
stubble. 
\v 29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 
\v 30 Sharp stones \add are\add* under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things
upon the mire. 
\v 31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of
ointment. 
\v 32 He maketh a path to shine after him; \add one\add* would think the deep
\add to be\add* hoary. 
\v 33 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 
\v 34 He beholdeth all high \add things:\add* he \add is\add* a king over all
the children of pride.
\c 42
\p
\v 1 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 
\v 2 I know that thou canst do every \add thing,\add* and \add that
\add* no thought can be withholden from thee. 
\v 3 Who \add is\add* he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have
I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew
not. 
\v 4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and
declare thou unto me. 
\v 5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth
thee. 
\v 6 Wherefore I abhor \add myself,\add* and repent in dust and ashes.
\p
\v 7 And it was \add so,\add* that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee,
and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me \add the thing that
is\add* right, as my servant Job \add hath. \add*
\v 8 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my
servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job
shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you \add after
your\add* folly, in that ye have not spoken of me \add the thing which is
\add* right, like my servant Job. 
\v 9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite \add and\add* Zophar the
Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also
accepted Job. 
\v 10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his
friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. 
\v 11 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all
they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in
his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the
LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every
one an earring of gold. 
\v 12 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for
he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke
of oxen, and a thousand she asses. 
\v 13 He had also seven sons and three daughters. 
\v 14 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second,
Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. 
\v 15 And in all the land were no women found \add so\add* fair as the
daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their
brethren. 
\v 16 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and
his sons’ sons, \add even\add* four generations. 
\v 17 So Job died, \add being\add* old and full of days.
