\h Isaiah
\mt The Book of the Prophet Isaiah 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and
Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, \add and\add* Hezekiah, kings
of Judah. 
\v 2 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath spoken, I have
nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me. 
\v 3 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: \add but
\add* Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider. 
\v 4 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers,
children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked
the Holy One of Israel unto anger, they are gone away backward.
\p
\v 5 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more: the
whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint. 
\v 6 From the sole of the foot even unto the head \add there is\add* no
soundness in it; \add but\add* wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they
have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment. 
\v 7 Your country \add is\add* desolate, your cities \add are\add* burned with
fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and \add it is
\add* desolate, as overthrown by strangers. 
\v 8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge
in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. 
\v 9 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should
have been as Sodom, \add and\add* we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
\p
\v 10 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of
our God, ye people of Gomorrah. 
\v 11 To what purpose \add is\add* the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed
beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he
goats. 
\v 12 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand,
to tread my courts? 
\v 13 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; the new
moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; \add it is
\add* iniquity, even the solemn meeting. 
\v 14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they are a
trouble unto me; I am weary to bear \add them. \add*
\v 15 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you:
yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of
blood.
\p
\v 16 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before
mine eyes; cease to do evil; 
\v 17 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the
fatherless, plead for the widow. 
\v 18 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins
be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like
crimson, they shall be as wool. 
\v 19 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: 
\v 20 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the
mouth of the LORD hath spoken \add it.\add*
\p
\v 21 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment;
righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers. 
\v 22 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water: 
\v 23 Thy princes \add are\add* rebellious, and companions of thieves: every
one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless,
neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them. 
\v 24 Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel,
Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies:
\p
\v 25 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy dross, and
take away all thy tin: 
\v 26 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at
the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called, The city of righteousness, the
faithful city. 
\v 27 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
righteousness.
\p
\v 28 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners \add shall
be\add* together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed. 
\v 29 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye
shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen. 
\v 30 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath
no water. 
\v 31 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a spark, and they
shall both burn together, and none shall quench \add them.\add*
\c 2
\p
\v 1 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 2 And it shall come to pass in the last days, \add that\add* the mountain
of the LORD’S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and
shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it. 
\v 3 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the
mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us
of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the
law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem. 
\v 4 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and
they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into
pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall
they learn war any more. 
\v 5 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the LORD.
\p
\v 6 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they
be replenished from the east, and \add are\add* soothsayers like the
Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers. 
\v 7 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither \add is there any
\add* end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither 
\add is there any\add* end of their chariots: 
\v 8 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own
hands, that which their own fingers have made: 
\v 9 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth himself:
therefore forgive them not.
\p
\v 10 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of the LORD,
and for the glory of his majesty. 
\v 11 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men
shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. 
\v 12 For the day of the LORD of hosts \add shall be\add* upon every 
\add one that is\add* proud and lofty, and upon every \add one that is
\add* lifted up; and he shall be brought low: 
\v 13 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, \add that are\add* high and lifted
up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan, 
\v 14 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills \add that are
\add* lifted up, 
\v 15 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall, 
\v 16 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant pictures. 
\v 17 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men
shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall be exalted in that day. 
\v 18 And the idols he shall utterly abolish. 
\v 19 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the
earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth
to shake terribly the earth. 
\v 20 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his idols of gold,
which they made \add each one\add* for himself to worship, to the moles and to
the bats; 
\v 21 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the ragged
rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth
to shake terribly the earth. 
\v 22 Cease ye from man, whose breath \add is\add* in his nostrils: for
wherein is he to be accounted of?
\c 3
\p
\v 1 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem
and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole
stay of water, 
\v 2 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the
prudent, and the ancient, 
\v 3 The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the
cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator. 
\v 4 And I will give children \add to be\add* their princes, and babes shall
rule over them. 
\v 5 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by
his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and
the base against the honourable. 
\v 6 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, 
\add saying,\add* Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and \add let
\add* this ruin \add be\add* under thy hand: 
\v 7 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my
house \add is\add* neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the
people. 
\v 8 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and
their doings \add are\add* against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his
glory.
\p
\v 9 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare
their sin as Sodom, they hide \add it\add* not. Woe unto their soul! for they
have rewarded evil unto themselves. 
\v 10 Say ye to the righteous, that \add it shall be\add* well \add with him:
\add* for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. 
\v 11 Woe unto the wicked! \add it shall be\add* ill \add with him:
\add* for the reward of his hands shall be given him.
\p
\v 12 \add As for\add* my people, children \add are\add* their oppressors, and
women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause \add thee
\add* to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. 
\v 13 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. 
\v 14 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and
the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor
\add is\add* in your houses. 
\v 15 What mean ye \add that\add* ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
faces of the poor? saith the LORD GOD of hosts.
\p
\v 16 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and
walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing 
\add as\add* they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: 
\v 17 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the
daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. 
\v 18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of \add their
\add* tinkling ornaments \add about their feet,\add* and \add their
\add* cauls, and \add their\add* round tires like the moon, 
\v 19 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, 
\v 20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the
tablets, and the earrings, 
\v 21 The rings, and nose jewels, 
\v 22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and
the crisping pins, 
\v 23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. 
\v 24 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* instead of sweet smell there
shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair
baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; \add and
\add* burning instead of beauty. 
\v 25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. 
\v 26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she \add being\add* desolate
shall sit upon the ground.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will
eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy
name, to take away our reproach. 
\v 2 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and glorious, and
the fruit of the earth \add shall be\add* excellent and comely for them that
are escaped of Israel. 
\v 3 And it shall come to pass, \add that he that is\add* left in Zion, and 
\add he that\add* remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, \add even
\add* every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem: 
\v 4 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion,
and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the
spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. 
\v 5 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount Zion, and
upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming
fire by night: for upon all the glory \add shall be\add* a defence. 
\v 6 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime from the
heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his
vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill: 
\v 2 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it
with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a
winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it
brought forth wild grapes. 
\v 3 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you,
betwixt me and my vineyard. 
\v 4 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in
it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it
forth wild grapes? 
\v 5 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take
away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; \add and\add* break down the
wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: 
\v 6 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged; but there
shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain
no rain upon it. 
\v 7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts \add is\add* the house of Israel,
and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for judgment, but
behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold a cry.
\p
\v 8 Woe unto them that join house to house, \add that\add* lay field to
field, till \add there be\add* no place, that they may be placed alone in the
midst of the earth! 
\v 9 In mine ears \add said\add* the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses
shall be desolate, \add even\add* great and fair, without inhabitant. 
\v 10 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an
homer shall yield an ephah.
\p
\v 11 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, \add that\add* they may
follow strong drink; that continue until night, \add till\add* wine inflame
them! 
\v 12 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their
feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the
operation of his hands.
\p
\v 13 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because \add they have
\add* no knowledge: and their honourable men \add are\add* famished, and their
multitude dried up with thirst. 
\v 14 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without
measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that
rejoiceth, shall descend into it. 
\v 15 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be
humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled: 
\v 16 But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy
shall be sanctified in righteousness. 
\v 17 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste places of
the fat ones shall strangers eat. 
\v 18 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it
were with a cart rope: 
\v 19 That say, Let him make speed, \add and\add* hasten his work, that we may
see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that
we may know \add it!\add*
\p
\v 20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for
light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for
bitter! 
\v 21 Woe unto \add them that are\add* wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
their own sight! 
\v 22 Woe unto \add them that are\add* mighty to drink wine, and men of
strength to mingle strong drink: 
\v 23 Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of
the righteous from him! 
\v 24 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame consumeth the
chaff, \add so\add* their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall
go up as dust: because they have cast away the law of the LORD of hosts, and
despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 25 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he
hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them: and the
hills did tremble, and their carcases \add were\add* torn in the midst of the
streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand \add is
\add* stretched out still.
\p
\v 26 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss
unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold, they shall come with speed
swiftly: 
\v 27 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor
sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of
their shoes be broken: 
\v 28 Whose arrows \add are\add* sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses’
hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind: 
\v 29 Their roaring \add shall be\add* like a lion, they shall roar like young
lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and shall carry 
\add it\add* away safe, and none shall deliver \add it. \add*
\v 30 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the
sea: and if \add one\add* look unto the land, behold darkness \add and
\add* sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

\p
\v 1 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a
throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple. 
\v 2 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he
covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did
fly. 
\v 3 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, \add is
\add* the LORD of hosts: the whole earth \add is\add* full of his glory. 
\v 4 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the
house was filled with smoke.
\p
\v 5 Then said I, Woe \add is\add* me! for I am undone; because I \add am
\add* a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts. 
\v 6 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, 
\add which\add* he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 
\v 7 And he laid \add it\add* upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched
thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged. 
\v 8 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who
will go for us? Then said I, Here \add am\add* I; send me.
\p
\v 9 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand
not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not. 
\v 10 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut
their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed. 
\v 11 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted
without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly
desolate, 
\v 12 And the LORD have removed men far away, and \add there be\add* a great
forsaking in the midst of the land.
\p
\v 13 But yet in it \add shall be\add* a tenth, and \add it\add* shall return,
and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them,
when they cast \add their leaves: so\add* the holy seed \add shall be
\add* the substance thereof.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of
Uzziah, king of Judah, \add that\add* Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the
son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it,
but could not prevail against it. 
\v 2 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is confederate with
Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of
the wood are moved with the wind. 
\v 3 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and
Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the
highway of the fuller’s field; 
\v 4 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither be
fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce
anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah. 
\v 5 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken evil counsel
against thee, saying, 
\v 6 Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach therein
for us, and set a king in the midst of it, \add even\add* the son of Tabeal: 
\v 7 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to
pass. 
\v 8 For the head of Syria \add is\add* Damascus, and the head of Damascus 
\add is\add* Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be
broken, that it be not a people. 
\v 9 And the head of Ephraim \add is\add* Samaria, and the head of Samaria 
\add is\add* Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
established.
\p
\v 10 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 
\v 11 Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the depth, or in
the height above. 
\v 12 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD. 
\v 13 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; \add Is it\add* a small
thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also? 
\v 14 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall
conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. 
\v 15 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil, and
choose the good. 
\v 16 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good,
the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings.
\p
\v 17 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy
father’s house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed
from Judah; \add even\add* the king of Assyria. 
\v 18 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the LORD shall
hiss for the fly that \add is\add* in the uttermost part of the rivers of
Egypt, and for the bee that \add is\add* in the land of Assyria. 
\v 19 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys,
and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorns, and upon all bushes. 
\v 20 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, 
\add namely,\add* by them beyond the river, by the king of Assyria, the head,
and the hair of the feet: and it shall also consume the beard. 
\v 21 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* a man shall
nourish a young cow, and two sheep; 
\v 22 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk \add that
\add* they shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every
one eat that is left in the land. 
\v 23 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* every place shall
be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings, it shall 
\add even\add* be for briers and thorns. 
\v 24 With arrows and with bows shall \add men\add* come thither; because all
the land shall become briers and thorns. 
\v 25 And \add on\add* all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there
shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it shall be for the
sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of lesser cattle.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and write in it
with a man’s pen concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 
\v 2 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and
Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah. 
\v 3 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son. Then
said the LORD to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 
\v 4 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my
mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away
before the king of Assyria.
\p
\v 5 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying, 
\v 6 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly,
and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son; 
\v 7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the
river, strong and many, \add even\add* the king of Assyria, and all his glory:
and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: 
\v 8 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall
reach \add even\add* to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall
fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
\p
\v 9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and
give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in
pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces. 
\v 10 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and
it shall not stand: for God \add is\add* with us.
\p
\v 11 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me that
I should not walk in the way of this people, saying, 
\v 12 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all \add them to\add* whom this people
shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. 
\v 13 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and \add let\add* him \add be
\add* your fear, and \add let\add* him \add be\add* your dread. 
\v 14 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a
rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the
inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
\v 15 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be
snared, and be taken. 
\v 16 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. 
\v 17 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the house of
Jacob, and I will look for him. 
\v 18 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me \add are
\add* for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which
dwelleth in mount Zion.
\p
\v 19 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar
spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter: should not a people seek
unto their God? for the living to the dead? 
\v 20 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this
word, \add it is\add* because \add there is\add* no light in them. 
\v 21 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and it shall
come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and
curse their king and their God, and look upward. 
\v 22 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and darkness,
dimness of anguish; and \add they shall be\add* driven to darkness.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Nevertheless the dimness \add shall\add* not \add be\add* such as 
\add was\add* in her vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land
of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more grievously afflict
\add her by\add* the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the
nations. 
\v 2 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that
dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. 
\v 3 Thou hast multiplied the nation, \add and\add* not increased the joy:
they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, \add and\add* as 
\add men\add* rejoice when they divide the spoil. 
\v 4 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his
shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian. 
\v 5 For every battle of the warrior \add is\add* with confused noise, and
garments rolled in blood; but \add this\add* shall be with burning \add and
\add* fuel of fire. 
\v 6 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government
shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful,
Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace. 
\v 7 Of the increase of \add his\add* government and peace \add there shall
be\add* no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it,
and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for
ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this.
\p
\v 8 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. 
\v 9 And all the people shall know, \add even\add* Ephraim and the inhabitant
of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart, 
\v 10 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the
sycomores are cut down, but we will change \add them into\add* cedars. 
\v 11 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him,
and join his enemies together; 
\v 12 The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour
Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his
hand \add is\add* stretched out still.
\p
\v 13 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they
seek the LORD of hosts. 
\v 14 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and
rush, in one day. 
\v 15 The ancient and honourable, he \add is\add* the head; and the prophet
that teacheth lies, he \add is\add* the tail. 
\v 16 For the leaders of this people cause \add them\add* to err; and 
\add they that are\add* led of them \add are\add* destroyed. 
\v 17 Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall
have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and
an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not
turned away, but his hand \add is\add* stretched out still.
\p
\v 18 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and
thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount
up \add like\add* the lifting up of smoke. 
\v 19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the
people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother. 
\v 20 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat
on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man
the flesh of his own arm: 
\v 21 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: \add and\add* they together 
\add shall be\add* against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away,
but his hand \add is\add* stretched out still.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
grievousness \add which\add* they have prescribed; 
\v 2 To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from
the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and \add that
\add* they may rob the fatherless! 
\v 3 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation 
\add which\add* shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for help? and where
will ye leave your glory? 
\v 4 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall
under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand 
\add is\add* stretched out still.
\p
\v 5 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand is mine
indignation. 
\v 6 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of
my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey,
and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. 
\v 7 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; but 
\add it is\add* in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few. 
\v 8 For he saith, \add Are\add* not my princes altogether kings? 
\v 9 \add Is\add* not Calno as Carchemish? \add is\add* not Hamath as Arpad? 
\add is\add* not Samaria as Damascus? 
\v 10 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images
did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria; 
\v 11 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to
Jerusalem and her idols? 
\v 12 Wherefore it shall come to pass, \add that\add* when the Lord hath
performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the
fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high
looks. 
\v 13 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done \add it,
\add* and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the
people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants
like a valiant \add man: \add*
\v 14 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one
gathereth eggs \add that are\add* left, have I gathered all the earth; and
there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped. 
\v 15 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith? 
\add or\add* shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it? as if
the rod should shake \add itself\add* against them that lift it up, 
\add or\add* as if the staff should lift up \add itself, as if it were
\add* no wood. 
\v 16 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones
leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a
fire. 
\v 17 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a
flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day; 
\v 18 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field,
both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth. 
\v 19 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may
write them.
\p
\v 20 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the remnant of
Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again
stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay upon the LORD, the Holy One of
Israel, in truth. 
\v 21 The remnant shall return, \add even\add* the remnant of Jacob, unto the
mighty God. 
\v 22 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, \add yet
\add* a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow
with righteousness. 
\v 23 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in
the midst of all the land.
\p
\v 24 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwellest in
Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite thee with a rod, and shall
lift up his staff against thee, after the manner of Egypt. 
\v 25 For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and mine
anger in their destruction. 
\v 26 And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the
slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and \add as\add* his rod \add was
\add* upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt. 
\v 27 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* his burden shall
be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the
yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing. 
\v 28 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he hath laid up
his carriages: 
\v 29 They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at
Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled. 
\v 30 Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard unto
Laish, O poor Anathoth. 
\v 31 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to
flee. 
\v 32 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand 
\add against\add* the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem. 
\v 33 Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror:
and the high ones of stature \add shall be\add* hewn down, and the haughty
shall be humbled. 
\v 34 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon
shall fall by a mighty one.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch
shall grow out of his roots: 
\v 2 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and
understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of
the fear of the LORD; 
\v 3 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the LORD: and he
shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing
of his ears: 
\v 4 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity
for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his
mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked. 
\v 5 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the
girdle of his reins. 
\v 6 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down
with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a
little child shall lead them. 
\v 7 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down
together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 
\v 8 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned
child shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den. 
\v 9 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth
shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.
\p
\v 10 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an
ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be
glorious. 
\v 11 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the Lord shall set
his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which
shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush,
and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the
sea. 
\v 12 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall assemble the
outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four
corners of the earth. 
\v 13 The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah
shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex
Ephraim. 
\v 14 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the
west; they shall spoil them of the east together: they shall lay their hand
upon Edom and Moab; and the children of Ammon shall obey them. 
\v 15 And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian sea; and
with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river, and shall smite
it in the seven streams, and make \add men\add* go over dryshod. 
\v 16 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall
be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out
of the land of Egypt.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee: though thou
wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedst me. 
\v 2 Behold, God \add is\add* my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid:
for the LORD JEHOVAH \add is\add* my strength and \add my\add* song; he also
is become my salvation. 
\v 3 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation. 
\v 4 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his name,
declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted. 
\v 5 Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this \add is
\add* known in all the earth. 
\v 6 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great \add is\add* the
Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. 
\v 2 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them,
shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. 
\v 3 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones
for mine anger, \add even\add* them that rejoice in my highness. 
\v 4 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a
tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of
hosts mustereth the host of the battle. 
\v 5 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, \add even
\add* the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole
land.
\p
\v 6 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD \add is\add* at hand; it shall come as a
destruction from the Almighty. 
\v 7 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man’s heart shall melt: 
\v 8 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they
shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at
another; their faces \add shall be as\add* flames. 
\v 9 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce
anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out
of it. 
\v 10 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give
their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall
not cause her light to shine. 
\v 11 And I will punish the world for \add their\add* evil, and the wicked for
their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will
lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. 
\v 12 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the
golden wedge of Ophir. 
\v 13 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of
her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce
anger. 
\v 14 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up:
they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own
land. 
\v 15 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is
joined \add unto them\add* shall fall by the sword. 
\v 16 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their
houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. 
\v 17 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard
silver; and \add as for\add* gold, they shall not delight in it. 
\v 18 \add Their\add* bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they
shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare
children.
\p
\v 19 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’
excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 
\v 20 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither
shall the shepherds make their fold there. 
\v 21 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be
full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance
there. 
\v 22 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses,
and dragons in \add their\add* pleasant palaces: and her time \add is
\add* near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and
set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and
they shall cleave to the house of Jacob. 
\v 2 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place: and the
house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the LORD for servants and
handmaids: and they shall take them captives, whose captives they were; and
they shall rule over their oppressors. 
\v 3 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give thee rest
from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou
wast made to serve,
\p
\v 4 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and
say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden city ceased! 
\v 5 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, \add and\add* the sceptre
of the rulers. 
\v 6 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled
the nations in anger, is persecuted, \add and\add* none hindereth. 
\v 7 The whole earth is at rest, \add and\add* is quiet: they break forth into
singing. 
\v 8 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, \add and\add* the cedars of Lebanon,
\add saying,\add* Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us. 
\v 9 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet \add thee\add* at thy coming:
it stirreth up the dead for thee, \add even\add* all the chief ones of the
earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. 
\v 10 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we?
art thou become like unto us? 
\v 11 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, \add and\add* the noise of thy
viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee. 
\v 12 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! 
\add how\add* art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken the
nations! 
\v 13 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will
exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the
congregation, in the sides of the north: 
\v 14 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most
High. 
\v 15 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the pit. 
\v 16 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, \add and\add* consider
thee, \add saying, Is\add* this the man that made the earth to tremble, that
did shake kingdoms; 
\v 17 \add That\add* made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
thereof; \add that\add* opened not the house of his prisoners? 
\v 18 All the kings of the nations, \add even\add* all of them, lie in glory,
every one in his own house. 
\v 19 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, 
\add and as\add* the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a
sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcase trodden under
feet. 
\v 20 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast
destroyed thy land, \add and\add* slain thy people: the seed of evildoers
shall never be renowned. 
\v 21 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers;
that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world
with cities. 
\v 22 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and cut off
from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and nephew, saith the LORD. 
\v 23 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water:
and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the LORD of hosts.
\p
\v 24 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have thought, so shall
it come to pass; and as I have purposed, \add so\add* shall it stand: 
\v 25 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread
him under foot: then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden
depart from off their shoulders. 
\v 26 This \add is\add* the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and
this \add is\add* the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations. 
\v 27 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul \add it?
\add* and his hand \add is\add* stretched out, and who shall turn it back? 
\v 28 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.
\p
\v 29 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote
thee is broken: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice,
and his fruit \add shall be\add* a fiery flying serpent. 
\v 30 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall lie down
in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and he shall slay thy
remnant. 
\v 31 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, \add art\add*
dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none \add shall
be\add* alone in his appointed times. 
\v 32 What shall \add one\add* then answer the messengers of the nation? That
the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall trust in it.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, 
\add and\add* brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid
waste, \add and\add* brought to silence; 
\v 2 He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep: Moab
shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their heads \add shall be
\add* baldness, \add and\add* every beard cut off. 
\v 3 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops
of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping
abundantly. 
\v 4 And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard 
\add even\add* unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out;
his life shall be grievous unto him. 
\v 5 My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives \add shall flee
\add* unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of
Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of Horonaim they shall
raise up a cry of destruction. 
\v 6 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is withered away,
the grass faileth, there is no green thing. 
\v 7 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid
up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows. 
\v 8 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof
unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beer-elim. 
\v 9 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more
upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and upon the remnant of the
land.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness,
unto the mount of the daughter of Zion. 
\v 2 For it shall be, \add that,\add* as a wandering bird cast out of the
nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon. 
\v 3 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst
of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him that wandereth. 
\v 4 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from
the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the spoiler
ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land. 
\v 5 And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit upon it in
truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and seeking judgment, and hasting
righteousness.
\p
\v 6 We have heard of the pride of Moab; \add he is\add* very proud: 
\add even\add* of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: \add but
\add* his lies \add shall\add* not \add be\add* so. 
\v 7 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for the
foundations of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn; surely \add they are\add*
stricken. 
\v 8 For the fields of Heshbon languish, \add and\add* the vine of Sibmah: the
lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof, they are
come \add even\add* unto Jazer, they wandered \add through\add* the
wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone over the sea.
\p
\v 9 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah: I
will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for the shouting for
thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen. 
\v 10 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful field; and in
the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be shouting: the
treaders shall tread out no wine in \add their\add* presses; I have made 
\add their vintage\add* shouting to cease. 
\v 11 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and mine inward
parts for Kir-haresh.
\p
\v 12 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary on the
high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not
prevail. 
\v 13 This \add is\add* the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab
since that time. 
\v 14 But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years
of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, with all that great
multitude; and the remnant \add shall be\add* very small \add and\add*
feeble.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from \add being
\add* a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap. 
\v 2 The cities of Aroer \add are\add* forsaken: they shall be for flocks,
which shall lie down, and none shall make \add them\add* afraid. 
\v 3 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from
Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children
of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 4 And in that day it shall come to pass, \add that\add* the glory of Jacob
shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean. 
\v 5 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and reapeth
the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley
of Rephaim.
\p
\v 6 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree,
two \add or\add* three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four 
\add or\add* five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the LORD God
of Israel. 
\v 7 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have
respect to the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 8 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall
respect \add that\add* which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the
images.
\p
\v 9 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an
uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there
shall be desolation. 
\v 10 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been
mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt thou plant pleasant
plants, and shalt set it with strange slips: 
\v 11 In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt
thou make thy seed to flourish: \add but\add* the harvest \add shall be
\add* a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.
\p
\v 12 Woe to the multitude of many people, \add which\add* make a noise like
the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, \add that\add* make a
rushing like the rushing of mighty waters! 
\v 13 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but \add God
\add* shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as
the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before
the whirlwind. 
\v 14 And behold at eveningtide trouble; \add and\add* before the morning he 
\add is\add* not. This \add is\add* the portion of them that spoil us, and the
lot of them that rob us.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which \add is\add* beyond the
rivers of Ethiopia: 
\v 2 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon
the waters, \add saying,\add* Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation scattered
and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted
out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled! 
\v 3 All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see ye, when
he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and when he bloweth a trumpet, hear
ye. 
\v 4 For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in
my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs, \add and\add* like a cloud of
dew in the heat of harvest. 
\v 5 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is
ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruninghooks,
and take away \add and\add* cut down the branches. 
\v 6 They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the
beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts
of the earth shall winter upon them.
\p
\v 7 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of hosts of a
people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning
hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers
have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift cloud, and
shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence,
and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it. 
\v 2 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight
every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city
against city, \add and\add* kingdom against kingdom. 
\v 3 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will
destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the
charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards. 
\v 4 And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a
fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts. 
\v 5 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and
dried up. 
\v 6 And they shall turn the rivers far away; \add and\add* the brooks of
defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither. 
\v 7 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every
thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no \add more. 
\add*
\v 8 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the
brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall
languish. 
\v 9 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall
be confounded. 
\v 10 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices
\add and\add* ponds for fish.
\p
\v 11 Surely the princes of Zoan \add are\add* fools, the counsel of the wise
counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I 
\add am\add* the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? 
\v 12 Where \add are\add* they? where \add are\add* thy wise \add men?
\add* and let them tell thee now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts
hath purposed upon Egypt. 
\v 13 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived;
they have also seduced Egypt, \add even they that are\add* the stay of the
tribes thereof. 
\v 14 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof: and they
have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken \add man
\add* staggereth in his vomit. 
\v 15 Neither shall there be \add any\add* work for Egypt, which the head or
tail, branch or rush, may do. 
\v 16 In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be afraid and
fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shaketh
over it. 
\v 17 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one that
maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of
the LORD of hosts, which he hath determined against it.
\p
\v 18 In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of
Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of
destruction. 
\v 19 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst of the land
of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD. 
\v 20 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of hosts in
the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD because of the oppressors,
and he shall send them a saviour, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.
\v 21 And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the
LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yea, they shall vow a
vow unto the LORD, and perform \add it. \add*
\v 22 And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal \add it:
\add* and they shall return \add even\add* to the LORD, and he shall be
intreated of them, and shall heal them.
\p
\v 23 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the
Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the
Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians. 
\v 24 In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, 
\add even\add* a blessing in the midst of the land: 
\v 25 Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed \add be\add* Egypt
my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the king of
Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took it; 
\v 2 At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and
loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot.
And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. 
\v 3 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and
barefoot three years \add for\add* a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon
Ethiopia; 
\v 4 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the
Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with \add their
\add* buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 
\v 5 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and
of Egypt their glory. 
\v 6 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such 
\add is\add* our expectation, whither we flee for help to be delivered from
the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?
\c 21
\p
\v 1 The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass
through; \add so\add* it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land. 
\v 2 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth
treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all
the sighing thereof have I made to cease. 
\v 3 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me,
as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing 
\add of it;\add* I was dismayed at the seeing \add of it. \add*
\v 4 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath
he turned into fear unto me. 
\v 5 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye
princes, \add and\add* anoint the shield. 
\v 6 For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare
what he seeth. 
\v 7 And he saw a chariot \add with\add* a couple of horsemen, a chariot of
asses, \add and\add* a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with
much heed: 
\v 8 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in
the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights: 
\v 9 And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, \add with\add* a couple of
horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the
graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground. 
\v 10 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the
LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.
\p
\v 11 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the
night? Watchman, what of the night? 
\v 12 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will
enquire, enquire ye: return, come.
\p
\v 13 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye
travelling companies of Dedanim. 
\v 14 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was
thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled. 
\v 15 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent
bow, and from the grievousness of war. 
\v 16 For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the
years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: 
\v 17 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children
of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken 
\add it.\add*
\c 22
\p
\v 1 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that thou art
wholly gone up to the housetops? 
\v 2 Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, a joyous city: thy slain
\add men are\add* not slain with the sword, nor dead in battle. 
\v 3 All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the archers: all that
are found in thee are bound together, \add which\add* have fled from far. 
\v 4 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly, labour not to
comfort me, because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people. 
\v 5 For \add it is\add* a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision, breaking down the
walls, and of crying to the mountains. 
\v 6 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men \add and\add* horsemen, and
Kir uncovered the shield. 
\v 7 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* thy choicest valleys shall be
full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate.
\p
\v 8 And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that day
to the armour of the house of the forest. 
\v 9 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they are many:
and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool. 
\v 10 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses have ye
broken down to fortify the wall. 
\v 11 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old
pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, neither had respect unto
him that fashioned it long ago. 
\v 12 And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and to
mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: 
\v 13 And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating
flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to morrow we shall die. 
\v 14 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely this
iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith the Lord GOD of
hosts.
\p
\v 15 Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, 
\add even\add* unto Shebna, which \add is\add* over the house, \add and say, 
\add*
\v 16 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee
out a sepulchre here, \add as\add* he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high,
\add and\add* that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock? 
\v 17 Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity, and will
surely cover thee. 
\v 18 He will surely violently turn and toss thee \add like\add* a ball into a
large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory 
\add shall be\add* the shame of thy lord’s house. 
\v 19 And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state shall he pull
thee down.
\p
\v 20 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 
\v 21 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle,
and I will commit thy government into his hand: and he shall be a father to
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah. 
\v 22 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder; so he
shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open. 
\v 23 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a
glorious throne to his father’s house. 
\v 24 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the
offspring and the issue, all vessels of small quantity, from the vessels of
cups, even to all the vessels of flagons. 
\v 25 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is fastened in
the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and fall; and the burden that 
\add was\add* upon it shall be cut off: for the LORD hath spoken \add it.
\add*
\c 23
\p
\v 1 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so
that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is
revealed to them. 
\v 2 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants of Zidon,
that pass over the sea, have replenished. 
\v 3 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, 
\add is\add* her revenue; and she is a mart of nations. 
\v 4 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, \add even\add* the
strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither
do I nourish up young men, \add nor\add* bring up virgins. 
\v 5 As at the report concerning Egypt, \add so\add* shall they be sorely
pained at the report of Tyre. 
\v 6 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle. 
\v 7 \add Is\add* this your joyous \add city,\add* whose antiquity \add is
\add* of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn. 
\v 8 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning \add city,
\add* whose merchants \add are\add* princes, whose traffickers \add are
\add* the honourable of the earth? 
\v 9 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, 
\add and\add* to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth. 
\v 10 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: \add there is
\add* no more strength. 
\v 11 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD
hath given a commandment against the merchant \add city,\add* to destroy the
strong holds thereof. 
\v 12 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin,
daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shalt thou have no
rest. 
\v 13 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, \add til
\add* the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set
up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; \add and
\add* he brought it to ruin. 
\v 14 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste. 
\v 15 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten
seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy
years shall Tyre sing as an harlot. 
\v 16 Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten;
make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be remembered.
\p
\v 17 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD
will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication
with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth. 
\v 18 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall
not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell
before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth
it upside down, and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof. 
\v 2 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the
servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with
the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as
with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him. 
\v 3 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for the LORD hath
spoken this word. 
\v 4 The earth mourneth \add and\add* fadeth away, the world languisheth 
\add and\add* fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish. 
\v 5 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they
have transgressed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting
covenant. 
\v 6 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein
are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men
left. 
\v 7 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do
sigh. 
\v 8 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the
joy of the harp ceaseth. 
\v 9 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be bitter to
them that drink it. 
\v 10 The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up, that no
man may come in. 
\v 11 \add There is\add* a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is
darkened, the mirth of the land is gone. 
\v 12 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
destruction.
\p
\v 13 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people, 
\add there shall be\add* as the shaking of an olive tree, \add and\add* as the
gleaning grapes when the vintage is done. 
\v 14 They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the majesty of the
LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea. 
\v 15 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, \add even\add* the name of
the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.
\p
\v 16 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, \add even
\add* glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto
me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous
dealers have dealt very treacherously. 
\v 17 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, \add are\add* upon thee, O inhabitant
of the earth. 
\v 18 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* he who fleeth from the noise
of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of
the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows from on high are open,
and the foundations of the earth do shake. 
\v 19 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the
earth is moved exceedingly. 
\v 20 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be removed
like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it; and it
shall fall, and not rise again. 
\v 21 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the LORD shall
punish the host of the high ones \add that are\add* on high, and the kings of
the earth upon the earth. 
\v 22 And they shall be gathered together, \add as\add* prisoners are gathered
in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days shall they
be visited. 
\v 23 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the LORD of
hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients
gloriously.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 O LORD, thou \add art\add* my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
name; for thou hast done wonderful \add things; thy\add* counsels of old 
\add are\add* faithfulness \add and\add* truth. 
\v 2 For thou hast made of a city an heap; \add of\add* a defenced city a
ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built. 
\v 3 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible
nations shall fear thee. 
\v 4 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his
distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of
the terrible ones \add is\add* as a storm \add against\add* the wall. 
\v 5 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place;
\add even\add* the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible
ones shall be brought low.
\p
\v 6 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast
of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of
wines on the lees well refined. 
\v 7 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over
all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations. 
\v 8 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away
tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from
off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken \add it.\add*
\p
\v 9 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this \add is\add* our God; we have
waited for him, and he will save us: this \add is\add* the LORD; we have
waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation. 
\v 10 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be
trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill. 
\v 11 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that
swimmeth spreadeth forth \add his hands\add* to swim: and he shall bring down
their pride together with the spoils of their hands. 
\v 12 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay
low, \add and\add* bring to the ground, \add even\add* to the dust.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a
strong city; salvation will \add God\add* appoint \add for\add* walls and
bulwarks. 
\v 2 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may
enter in. 
\v 3 Thou wilt keep \add him\add* in perfect peace, \add whose\add* mind 
\add is\add* stayed \add on thee:\add* because he trusteth in thee. 
\v 4 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH \add is
\add* everlasting strength:
\p
\v 5 For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth
it low; he layeth it low, \add even\add* to the ground; he bringeth it 
\add even\add* to the dust. 
\v 6 The foot shall tread it down, \add even\add* the feet of the poor, 
\add and\add* the steps of the needy. 
\v 7 The way of the just \add is\add* uprightness: thou, most upright, dost
weigh the path of the just. 
\v 8 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the
desire of \add our\add* soul \add is\add* to thy name, and to the remembrance
of thee. 
\v 9 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within
me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments \add are\add* in the earth,
the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness. 
\v 10 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, \add yet\add* will he not learn
righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not
behold the majesty of the LORD. 
\v 11 LORD, \add when\add* thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: 
\add but\add* they shall see, and be ashamed for \add their\add* envy at the
people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.
\p
\v 12 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our
works in us. 
\v 13 O LORD our God, \add other\add* lords besides thee have had dominion
over us: \add but\add* by thee only will we make mention of thy name. 
\v 14 \add They are\add* dead, they shall not live; \add they are\add*
deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them,
and made all their memory to perish. 
\v 15 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation:
thou art glorified: thou hadst removed \add it\add* far \add unto\add* all the
ends of the earth. 
\v 16 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer 
\add when\add* thy chastening \add was\add* upon them. 
\v 17 Like as a woman with child, \add that\add* draweth near the time of her
delivery, is in pain, \add and\add* crieth out in her pangs; so have we been
in thy sight, O LORD. 
\v 18 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were
brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither
have the inhabitants of the world fallen. 
\v 19 Thy dead \add men\add* shall live, \add together with\add* my dead body
shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew 
\add is as\add* the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
\p
\v 20 Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about
thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be
overpast. 
\v 21 For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants
of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and
shall no more cover her slain.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword shall
punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan that crooked serpent;
and he shall slay the dragon that \add is\add* in the sea. 
\v 2 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine. 
\v 3 I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest \add any
\add* hurt it, I will keep it night and day. 
\v 4 Fury \add is\add* not in me: who would set the briers \add and
\add* thorns against me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them
together. 
\v 5 Or let him take hold of my strength, \add that\add* he may make peace
with me; \add and\add* he shall make peace with me. 
\v 6 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel shall blossom
and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.
\p
\v 7 Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? \add or
\add* is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him? 
\v 8 In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it: he stayeth
his rough wind in the day of the east wind. 
\v 9 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this is all
the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all the stones of the altar as
chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, the groves and images shall not stand
up. 
\v 10 Yet the defenced city \add shall be\add* desolate, \add and\add* the
habitation forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed,
and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof. 
\v 11 When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off: the
women come, \add and\add* set them on fire: for it \add is\add* a people of no
understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he
that formed them will shew them no favour.
\p
\v 12 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the LORD shall
beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of Egypt, and ye shall
be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel. 
\v 13 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the great trumpet
shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of
Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in
the holy mount at Jerusalem.

\p
\v 1 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious
beauty is a fading flower, which \add are\add* on the head of the fat valleys
of them that are overcome with wine! 
\v 2 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, \add which\add* as a
tempest of hail \add and\add* a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters
overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand. 
\v 3 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under
feet: 
\v 4 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be
a fading flower, \add and\add* as the hasty fruit before the summer; which 
\add when\add* he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he
eateth it up.
\p
\v 5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a
diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people, 
\v 6 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment, and for
strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.
\p
\v 7 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out
of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they
are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they
err in vision, they stumble \add in\add* judgment. 
\v 8 For all tables are full of vomit \add and\add* filthiness, \add so that
there is\add* no place \add clean.\add*
\p
\v 9 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand
doctrine? \add them that are\add* weaned from the milk, \add and\add* drawn
from the breasts. 
\v 10 For precept \add must be\add* upon precept, precept upon precept; line
upon line, line upon line; here a little, \add and\add* there a little: 
\v 11 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this
people. 
\v 12 To whom he said, This \add is\add* the rest \add wherewith\add* ye may
cause the weary to rest; and this \add is\add* the refreshing: yet they would
not hear. 
\v 13 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept, precept
upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, \add and
\add* there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken,
and snared, and taken.
\p
\v 14 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule this
people which \add is\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 15 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell
are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall
not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have
we hid ourselves:
\p
\v 16 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner \add stone,\add* a sure
foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste. 
\v 17 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet:
and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall
overflow the hiding place.
\p
\v 18 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement
with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through,
then ye shall be trodden down by it. 
\v 19 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for morning by
morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation
only to understand the report. 
\v 20 For the bed is shorter than that \add a man\add* can stretch himself 
\add on it:\add* and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself 
\add in it. \add*
\v 21 For the LORD shall rise up as \add in\add* mount Perazim, he shall be
wroth as \add in\add* the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his
strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act. 
\v 22 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I
have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined upon the
whole earth.
\p
\v 23 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech. 
\v 24 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break the clods
of his ground? 
\v 25 When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast abroad the
fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the
appointed barley and rie in their place? 
\v 26 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, \add and\add* doth teach
him. 
\v 27 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is
a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with
a staff, and the cummin with a rod. 
\v 28 Bread \add corn\add* is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing
it, nor break \add it with\add* the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it 
\add with\add* his horsemen. 
\v 29 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, \add which\add* is
wonderful in counsel, \add and\add* excellent in working.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city \add where\add* David dwelt! add ye year
to year; let them kill sacrifices. 
\v 2 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and
it shall be unto me as Ariel. 
\v 3 And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee
with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee. 
\v 4 And thou shalt be brought down, \add and\add* shalt speak out of the
ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be,
as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall
whisper out of the dust. 
\v 5 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust, and the
multitude of the terrible ones \add shall be\add* as chaff that passeth away:
yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly. 
\v 6 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with
earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of
devouring fire.
\p
\v 7 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all
that fight against her and her munition, and that distress her, shall be as a
dream of a night vision. 
\v 8 It shall even be as when an hungry \add man\add* dreameth, and, behold,
he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man
dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, \add he is
\add* faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the
nations be, that fight against mount Zion. 
\v 9 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are drunken, but
not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink. 
\v 10 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath
closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers hath he covered. 
\v 11 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is
sealed, which \add men\add* deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this,
I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it \add is\add* sealed: 
\v 12 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this,
I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.
\p
\v 13 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near \add me
\add* with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed
their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of
men: 
\v 14 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this
people, \add even\add* a marvellous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their
wise \add men\add* shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent 
\add men\add* shall be hid. 
\v 15 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and
their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? 
\v 16 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the
potter’s clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or
shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding? 
\v 17 \add Is\add* it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned
into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?
\p
\v 18 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes
of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness. 
\v 19 The meek also shall increase \add their\add* joy in the LORD, and the
poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 20 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is consumed,
and all that watch for iniquity are cut off: 
\v 21 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that
reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nought. 
\v 22 Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the
house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax
pale. 
\v 23 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the midst of
him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and
shall fear the God of Israel. 
\v 24 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they
that murmured shall learn doctrine.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take counsel, but
not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my spirit, that they may
add sin to sin: 
\v 2 That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth; to
strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the shadow
of Egypt! 
\v 3 Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the trust in
the shadow of Egypt \add your\add* confusion. 
\v 4 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to Hanes. 
\v 5 They were all ashamed of a people \add that\add* could not profit them,
nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach. 
\v 6 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and
anguish, from whence \add come\add* the young and old lion, the viper and
fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young
asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people \add that
\add* shall not profit \add them. \add*
\v 7 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I
cried concerning this, Their strength \add is\add* to sit still.
\p
\v 8 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it
may be for the time to come for ever and ever: 
\v 9 That this \add is\add* a rebellious people, lying children, children 
\add that\add* will not hear the law of the LORD: 
\v 10 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto
us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits: 
\v 11 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One
of Israel to cease from before us. 
\v 12 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this
word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay thereon: 
\v 13 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall,
swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant. 
\v 14 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel that is
broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the
bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to take water 
\add withal\add* out of the pit. 
\v 15 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and
rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength:
and ye would not. 
\v 16 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee:
and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be
swift. 
\v 17 One thousand \add shall flee\add* at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain,
and as an ensign on an hill.
\p
\v 18 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and
therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD 
\add is\add* a God of judgment: blessed \add are\add* all they that wait for
him. 
\v 19 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no
more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry; when he
shall hear it, he will answer thee. 
\v 20 And \add though\add* the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any
more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers: 
\v 21 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This \add is
\add* the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn
to the left. 
\v 22 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver, and
the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a
menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee hence. 
\v 23 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow the ground
withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall be fat and
plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures. 
\v 24 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat
clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan. 
\v 25 And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill,
rivers \add and\add* streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when
the towers fall. 
\v 26 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the
light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day
that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the stroke of
their wound.
\p
\v 27 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning \add with
\add* his anger, and the burden \add thereof is\add* heavy: his lips are full
of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire: 
\v 28 And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the midst of
the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and \add there shall
be\add* a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing \add them\add* to err. 
\v 29 Ye shall have a song, as in the night \add when\add* a holy solemnity is
kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the
mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel. 
\v 30 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall shew
the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of \add his\add* anger, and
\add with\add* the flame of a devouring fire, \add with\add* scattering, and
tempest, and hailstones. 
\v 31 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten down, 
\add which\add* smote with a rod. 
\v 32 And \add in\add* every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
the LORD shall lay upon him, \add it\add* shall be with tabrets and harps: and
in battles of shaking will he fight with it. 
\v 33 For Tophet \add is\add* ordained of old; yea, for the king it is
prepared; he hath made \add it\add* deep \add and\add* large: the pile thereof
\add is\add* fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of
brimstone, doth kindle it.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust
in chariots, because \add they are\add* many; and in horsemen, because they
are very strong; but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek
the LORD! 
\v 2 Yet he also \add is\add* wise, and will bring evil, and will not call
back his words: but will arise against the house of the evildoers, and against
the help of them that work iniquity. 
\v 3 Now the Egyptians \add are\add* men, and not God; and their horses flesh,
and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he that helpeth
shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall down, and they all shall fail
together. 
\v 4 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and the young
lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of shepherds is called forth
against him, \add he\add* will not be afraid of their voice, nor abase himself
for the noise of them: so shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount
Zion, and for the hill thereof. 
\v 5 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem; defending
also he will deliver \add it; and\add* passing over he will preserve 
\add it.\add*
\p
\v 6 Turn ye unto \add him from\add* whom the children of Israel have deeply
revolted. 
\v 7 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his
idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you \add for\add* a sin.
\p
\v 8 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty man; and the
sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the sword,
and his young men shall be discomfited. 
\v 9 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall
be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose fire \add is\add* in Zion, and
his furnace in Jerusalem.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in
judgment. 
\v 2 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from
the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock
in a weary land. 
\v 3 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that
hear shall hearken. 
\v 4 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of
the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly. 
\v 5 The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said 
\add to be\add* bountiful. 
\v 6 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity,
to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the
soul of the hungry, and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail. 
\v 7 The instruments also of the churl \add are\add* evil: he deviseth wicked
devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the needy speaketh
right. 
\v 8 But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things shall he
stand.
\p
\v 9 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters;
give ear unto my speech. 
\v 10 Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the
vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come. 
\v 11 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip
you, and make you bare, and gird \add sackcloth\add* upon \add your
\add* loins. 
\v 12 They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for the
fruitful vine. 
\v 13 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns \add and\add* briers;
yea, upon all the houses of joy \add in\add* the joyous city: 
\v 14 Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the city shall
be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses,
a pasture of flocks; 
\v 15 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness be a
fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest. 
\v 16 Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness remain in
the fruitful field. 
\v 17 And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of
righteousness quietness and assurance for ever. 
\v 18 And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in sure
dwellings, and in quiet resting places; 
\v 19 When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city shall be low
in a low place. 
\v 20 Blessed \add are\add* ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth 
\add thither\add* the feet of the ox and the ass.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou \add wast\add* not spoiled; and
dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou
shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; \add and\add* when thou shalt
make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee. 
\v 2 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm
every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble. 
\v 3 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself
the nations were scattered. 
\v 4 And your spoil shall be gathered \add like\add* the gathering of the
caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them. 
\v 5 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with
judgment and righteousness. 
\v 6 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, \add and
\add* strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD \add is\add* his treasure. 
\v 7 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace
shall weep bitterly. 
\v 8 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the
covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man. 
\v 9 The earth mourneth \add and\add* languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed 
\add and\add* hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel
shake off \add their fruits. \add*
\v 10 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift
up myself. 
\v 11 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, 
\add as\add* fire, shall devour you. 
\v 12 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: \add as\add* thorns cut
up shall they be burned in the fire.
\p
\v 13 Hear, ye \add that are\add* far off, what I have done; and, ye 
\add that are\add* near, acknowledge my might. 
\v 14 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us
shall dwell with everlasting burnings? 
\v 15 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth
the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that
stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing
evil; 
\v 16 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence \add shall be\add* the
munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters \add shall be
\add* sure. 
\v 17 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land
that is very far off. 
\v 18 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where \add is\add* the scribe? where
\add is\add* the receiver? where \add is\add* he that counted the towers? 
\v 19 Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than
thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, \add that thou canst\add* not
understand. 
\v 20 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see
Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle \add that\add* shall not be taken
down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any
of the cords thereof be broken. 
\v 21 But there the glorious LORD \add will be\add* unto us a place of broad
rivers \add and\add* streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither
shall gallant ship pass thereby. 
\v 22 For the LORD \add is\add* our judge, the LORD \add is\add* our lawgiver,
the LORD \add is\add* our king; he will save us. 
\v 23 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast,
they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the
lame take the prey. 
\v 24 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell
therein \add shall be\add* forgiven \add their\add* iniquity.
\c 34
\p
\v 1 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let the earth
hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of
it. 
\v 2 For the indignation of the LORD \add is\add* upon all nations, and 
\add his\add* fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he
hath delivered them to the slaughter. 
\v 3 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of
their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood. 
\v 4 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be
rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall fall down, as the leaf
falleth off from the vine, and as a falling \add fig\add* from the fig tree. 
\v 5 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon
Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment. 
\v 6 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness,
\add and\add* with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys
of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the
land of Idumea. 
\v 7 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the
bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with
fatness. 
\v 8 For \add it is\add* the day of the LORD’S vengeance, \add and\add* the
year of recompences for the controversy of Zion. 
\v 9 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof
into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. 
\v 10 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up
for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass
through it for ever and ever. 
\v 11 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the
raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out upon it the line of
confusion, and the stones of emptiness. 
\v 12 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none \add shall
be\add* there, and all her princes shall be nothing. 
\v 13 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the
fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of dragons, \add and
\add* a court for owls. 
\v 14 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of
the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl also shall
rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. 
\v 15 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather
under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with
her mate.
\p
\v 16 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these shall
fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his spirit
it hath gathered them. 
\v 17 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto
them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation
shall they dwell therein.
\c 35
\p
\v 1 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the
desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. 
\v 2 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the
glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon,
they shall see the glory of the LORD, \add and\add* the excellency of our
God.
\p
\v 3 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. 
\v 4 Say to them \add that are\add* of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
behold, your God will come \add with\add* vengeance, \add even\add* God 
\add with\add* a recompence; he will come and save you. 
\v 5 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf
shall be unstopped. 
\v 6 Then shall the lame \add man\add* leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the
desert. 
\v 7 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs
of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, \add shall be
\add* grass with reeds and rushes. 
\v 8 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way
of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it \add shall be
\add* for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err \add therein.
\add*
\v 9 No lion shall be there, nor \add any\add* ravenous beast shall go up
thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk \add there:
\add*
\v 10 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs
and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and
sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
\c 36
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, \add that
\add* Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of
Judah, and took them. 
\v 2 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto
king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool
in the highway of the fuller’s field. 
\v 3 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over the
house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the recorder.
\p
\v 4 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the
great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein thou
trustest? 
\v 5 I say, \add sayest thou,\add* (but \add they are but\add* vain words) 
\add I have\add* counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust,
that thou rebellest against me? 
\v 6 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; whereon if
a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so \add is\add* Pharaoh
king of Egypt to all that trust in him. 
\v 7 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: \add is it
\add* not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away, and
said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar? 
\v 8 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of
Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on thy part
to set riders upon them. 
\v 9 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my
master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen? 
\v 10 And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it?
the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
\p
\v 11 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray
thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we understand \add it:
\add* and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people
that \add are\add* on the wall.
\p
\v 12 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to
speak these words? \add hath he\add* not \add sent me\add* to the men that sit
upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own piss with
you? 
\v 13 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language,
and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
\v 14 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be
able to deliver you. 
\v 15 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will
surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king
of Assyria. 
\v 16 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make 
\add an agreement\add* with me \add by\add* a present, and come out to me: and
eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink ye
every one the waters of his own cistern; 
\v 17 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of
corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
\v 18 \add Beware\add* lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The LORD will
deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the
hand of the king of Assyria? 
\v 19 Where \add are\add* the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where \add are
\add* the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
\v 20 Who \add are they\add* among all the gods of these lands, that have
delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem
out of my hand? 
\v 21 But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s
commandment was, saying, Answer him not.
\p
\v 22 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that \add was\add* over the
household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to
Hezekiah with \add their\add* clothes rent, and told him the words of
Rabshakeh.
\c 37
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard \add it,\add* that he rent
his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of
the LORD. 
\v 2 And he sent Eliakim, who \add was\add* over the household, and Shebna the
scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth, unto Isaiah the
prophet the son of Amoz. 
\v 3 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day \add is\add* a day
of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the
birth, and \add there is\add* not strength to bring forth. 
\v 4 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the
king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and will
reprove the words which the LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up 
\add thy\add* prayer for the remnant that is left. 
\v 5 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
\p
\v 6 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith
the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the
servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 
\v 7 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a rumour, and
return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own
land.
\p
\v 8 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against
Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish. 
\v 9 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth
to make war with thee. And when he heard \add it,\add* he sent messengers to
Hezekiah, saying, 
\v 10 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God,
in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into
the hand of the king of Assyria. 
\v 11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands
by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered? 
\v 12 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have
destroyed, \add as\add* Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden
which \add were\add* in Telassar? 
\v 13 Where \add is\add* the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the
king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?
\p
\v 14 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and
read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the LORD, and spread it before
the LORD. 
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying, 
\v 16 O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest \add between\add* the
cherubims, thou \add art\add* the God, \add even\add* thou alone, of all the
kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth. 
\v 17 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD, and see:
and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent to reproach the living
God. 
\v 18 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations,
and their countries, 
\v 19 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they \add were\add* no gods,
but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone: therefore they have destroyed
them. 
\v 20 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all the
kingdoms of the earth may know that thou \add art\add* the LORD, \add even
\add* thou only.
\p
\v 21 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the
LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me against Sennacherib king of
Assyria: 
\v 22 This \add is\add* the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him;
The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, \add and\add* laughed
thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee. 
\v 23 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou
exalted \add thy\add* voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high? \add even
\add* against the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 24 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the
multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the
sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof, \add and
\add* the choice fir trees thereof: and I will enter into the height of his
border, \add and\add* the forest of his Carmel. 
\v 25 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I
dried up all the rivers of the besieged places. 
\v 26 Hast thou not heard long ago, \add how\add* I have done it; \add and
\add* of ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pass,
that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities \add into\add* ruinous
heaps. 
\v 27 Therefore their inhabitants \add were\add* of small power, they were
dismayed and confounded: they were \add as\add* the grass of the field, and 
\add as\add* the green herb, \add as\add* the grass on the housetops, and 
\add as corn\add* blasted before it be grown up. 
\v 28 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage
against me. 
\v 29 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into mine ears,
therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I
will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. 
\v 30 And this \add shall be\add* a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat \add this
\add* year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth
of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and
eat the fruit thereof. 
\v 31 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take
root downward, and bear fruit upward: 
\v 32 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out
of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this. 
\v 33 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria, He shall
not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with
shields, nor cast a bank against it. 
\v 34 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come
into this city, saith the LORD. 
\v 35 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and for my
servant David’s sake. 
\v 36 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp of the
Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early
in the morning, behold, they \add were\add* all dead corpses.
\p
\v 37 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and
dwelt at Nineveh. 
\v 38 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his
god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they
escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esar-haddon his son reigned in his
stead.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the
son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine
house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live. 
\v 2 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
\v 3 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before
thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done \add that which is
\add* good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
\p
\v 4 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying, 
\v 5 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy
father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add
unto thy days fifteen years. 
\v 6 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of
Assyria: and I will defend this city. 
\v 7 And this \add shall be\add* a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD
will do this thing that he hath spoken; 
\v 8 Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down
in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten
degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
\p
\v 9 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was
recovered of his sickness: 
\v 10 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the
grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years. 
\v 11 I said, I shall not see the LORD, \add even\add* the LORD, in the land
of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world. 
\v 12 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd’s tent: I
have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness:
from day \add even\add* to night wilt thou make an end of me. 
\v 13 I reckoned till morning, \add that,\add* as a lion, so will he break all
my bones: from day \add even\add* to night wilt thou make an end of me. 
\v 14 Like a crane \add or\add* a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
dove: mine eyes fail \add with looking\add* upward: O LORD, I am oppressed;
undertake for me. 
\v 15 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done 
\add it:\add* I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul. 
\v 16 O Lord, by these \add things men\add* live, and in all these \add things
is\add* the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live. 
\v 17 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my
soul \add delivered it\add* from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all
my sins behind thy back. 
\v 18 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can \add not\add* celebrate
thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth. 
\v 19 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I \add do\add* this
day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth. 
\v 20 The LORD \add was ready\add* to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the
LORD. 
\v 21 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay \add it
\add* for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover. 
\v 22 Hezekiah also had said, What \add is\add* the sign that I shall go up to
the house of the LORD?
\c 39
\p
\v 1 At that time Merodach-baladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent
letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had heard that he had been sick, and
was recovered. 
\v 2 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of his precious
things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment,
and all the house of his armour, and all that was found in his treasures:
there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed
them not.
\p
\v 3 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto him, What
said these men? and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They
are come from a far country unto me, \add even\add* from Babylon. 
\v 4 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered,
All that \add is\add* in mine house have they seen: there is nothing among my
treasures that I have not shewed them. 
\v 5 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of hosts: 
\v 6 Behold, the days come, that all that \add is\add* in thine house, and 
\add that\add* which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall
be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the LORD. 
\v 7 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall
they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of
Babylon. 
\v 8 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good \add is\add* the word of the LORD
which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be peace and truth
in my days.
\c 40
\p
\v 1 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God. 
\v 2 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is
accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received of the
LORD’S hand double for all her sins.
\p
\v 3 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the
LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God. 
\v 4 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made
low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: 
\v 5 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see 
\add it\add* together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken \add it. 
\add*
\v 6 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh \add is
\add* grass, and all the goodliness thereof \add is\add* as the flower of the
field: 
\v 7 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD
bloweth upon it: surely the people \add is\add* grass. 
\v 8 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall
stand for ever.
\p
\v 9 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain; O
Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift 
\add it\add* up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your
God! 
\v 10 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong \add hand,\add* and his arm
shall rule for him: behold, his reward \add is\add* with him, and his work
before him. 
\v 11 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with
his arm, and carry \add them\add* in his bosom, \add and\add* shall gently
lead those that are with young.
\p
\v 12 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out
heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and
weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? 
\v 13 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or \add being\add* his
counsellor hath taught him? 
\v 14 With whom took he counsel, and \add who\add* instructed him, and taught
him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the
way of understanding? 
\v 15 Behold, the nations \add are\add* as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very
little thing. 
\v 16 And Lebanon \add is\add* not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
sufficient for a burnt offering. 
\v 17 All nations before him \add are\add* as nothing; and they are counted to
him less than nothing, and vanity.
\p
\v 18 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto
him? 
\v 19 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over
with gold, and casteth silver chains. 
\v 20 He that \add is\add* so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
tree \add that\add* will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to
prepare a graven image, \add that\add* shall not be moved. 
\v 21 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the
beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? 
\v 22 \add It is\add* he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
inhabitants thereof \add are\add* as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the
heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in: 
\v 23 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth
as vanity. 
\v 24 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown: yea, their
stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and
they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble. 
\v 25 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.
\v 26 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these \add things,
\add* that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by
the greatness of his might, for that \add he is\add* strong in power; not one
faileth. 
\v 27 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the
LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?
\p
\v 28 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, \add that\add* the everlasting
God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is
weary? \add there is\add* no searching of his understanding. 
\v 29 He giveth power to the faint; and to \add them that have\add* no might
he increaseth strength. 
\v 30 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall
utterly fall: 
\v 31 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew \add their\add* strength;
they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; 
\add and\add* they shall walk, and not faint.
\c 41
\p
\v 1 Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew \add their
\add* strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near
together to judgment. 
\v 2 Who raised up the righteous \add man\add* from the east, called him to
his foot, gave the nations before him, and made \add him\add* rule over kings?
he gave \add them\add* as the dust to his sword, \add and\add* as driven
stubble to his bow. 
\v 3 He pursued them, \add and\add* passed safely; \add even\add* by the way 
\add that\add* he had not gone with his feet. 
\v 4 Who hath wrought and done \add it,\add* calling the generations from the
beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I \add am\add* he. 
\v 5 The isles saw \add it,\add* and feared; the ends of the earth were
afraid, drew near, and came. 
\v 6 They helped every one his neighbour; and \add every one\add* said to his
brother, Be of good courage. 
\v 7 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, \add and\add* he that
smootheth \add with\add* the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is
ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, \add that\add* it
should not be moved. 
\v 8 But thou, Israel, \add art\add* my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the
seed of Abraham my friend. 
\v 9 \add Thou\add* whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called
thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou \add art\add* my
servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.
\p
\v 10 Fear thou not; for I \add am\add* with thee: be not dismayed; for I 
\add am\add* thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I
will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness. 
\v 11 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and
confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with thee shall
perish. 
\v 12 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, \add even\add* them that
contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a
thing of nought. 
\v 13 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear
not; I will help thee. 
\v 14 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, \add and\add* ye men of Israel; I will help
thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 15 Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth:
thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat \add them\add* small, and shalt make
the hills as chaff. 
\v 16 Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the
whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in the LORD, \add and
\add* shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 17 \add When\add* the poor and needy seek water, and \add there is
\add* none, \add and\add* their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will
hear them, \add I\add* the God of Israel will not forsake them. 
\v 18 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the
valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs
of water. 
\v 19 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the
myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, \add and
\add* the pine, and the box tree together: 
\v 20 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that
the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created
it. 
\v 21 Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong \add reasons,
\add* saith the King of Jacob. 
\v 22 Let them bring \add them\add* forth, and shew us what shall happen: let
them shew the former things, what they \add be,\add* that we may consider
them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come. 
\v 23 Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye 
\add are\add* gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and
behold \add it\add* together. 
\v 24 Behold, ye \add are\add* of nothing, and your work of nought: an
abomination \add is he that\add* chooseth you. 
\v 25 I have raised up \add one\add* from the north, and he shall come: from
the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall come upon
princes as \add upon\add* morter, and as the potter treadeth clay. 
\v 26 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime,
that we may say, \add He is\add* righteous? yea, \add there is\add* none that
sheweth, yea, \add there is\add* none that declareth, yea, \add there is
\add* none that heareth your words. 
\v 27 The first \add shall say\add* to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will
give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings. 
\v 28 For I beheld, and \add there was\add* no man; even among them, and 
\add there was\add* no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a
word. 
\v 29 Behold, they \add are\add* all vanity; their works \add are\add*
nothing: their molten images \add are\add* wind and confusion.
\c 42
\p
\v 1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, \add in whom\add* my soul
delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to
the Gentiles. 
\v 2 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the
street. 
\v 3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not
quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth. 
\v 4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the
earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.
\p
\v 5 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them
out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that
giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: 
\v 6 I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand,
and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of
the Gentiles; 
\v 7 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, 
\add and\add* them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. 
\v 8 I \add am\add* the LORD: that \add is\add* my name: and my glory will I
not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. 
\v 9 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare:
before they spring forth I tell you of them. 
\v 10 Sing unto the LORD a new song, \add and\add* his praise from the end of
the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and
the inhabitants thereof. 
\v 11 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up \add their voice,
\add* the villages \add that\add* Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of
the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains. 
\v 12 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the
islands. 
\v 13 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like
a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies. 
\v 14 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, \add and
\add* refrained myself: \add now\add* will I cry like a travailing woman; I
will destroy and devour at once. 
\v 15 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I
will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools. 
\v 16 And I will bring the blind by a way \add that\add* they knew not; I will
lead them in paths \add that\add* they have not known: I will make darkness
light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto
them, and not forsake them.
\p
\v 17 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in
graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye \add are\add* our gods. 
\v 18 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see. 
\v 19 Who \add is\add* blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger 
\add that\add* I sent? who \add is\add* blind as \add he that is\add* perfect,
and blind as the LORD’S servant? 
\v 20 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he
heareth not. 
\v 21 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify
the law, and make \add it\add* honourable. 
\v 22 But this \add is\add* a people robbed and spoiled; \add they are
\add* all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are
for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore. 
\v 23 Who among you will give ear to this? \add who\add* will hearken and hear
for the time to come? 
\v 24 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD,
he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither
were they obedient unto his law. 
\v 25 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the
strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not;
and it burned him, yet he laid \add it\add* not to heart.
\c 43
\p
\v 1 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that
formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called 
\add thee\add* by thy name; thou \add art\add* mine. 
\v 2 When thou passest through the waters, I \add will be\add* with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through
the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
\v 3 For I \add am\add* the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour:
I gave Egypt \add for\add* thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee. 
\v 4 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I
have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.
\v 5 Fear not: for I \add am\add* with thee: I will bring thy seed from the
east, and gather thee from the west; 
\v 6 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring
my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; 
\v 7 \add Even\add* every one that is called by my name: for I have created
him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.
\p
\v 8 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have
ears. 
\v 9 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be
assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let
them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them
hear, and say, \add It is\add* truth. 
\v 10 Ye \add are\add* my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I
have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I 
\add am\add* he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be
after me. 
\v 11 I, \add even\add* I, \add am\add* the LORD; and beside me \add there is
\add* no saviour. 
\v 12 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when \add there was
\add* no strange \add god\add* among you: therefore ye \add are\add* my
witnesses, saith the LORD, that I \add am\add* God. 
\v 13 Yea, before the day \add was\add* I \add am\add* he; and \add there is
\add* none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let
it?
\p
\v 14 Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your
sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the
Chaldeans, whose cry \add is\add* in the ships. 
\v 15 I \add am\add* the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your
King. 
\v 16 Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the
mighty waters; 
\v 17 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they
shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are
quenched as tow.
\p
\v 18 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old. 
\v 19 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not
know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, \add and\add* rivers in the
desert. 
\v 20 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls:
because I give waters in the wilderness, \add and\add* rivers in the desert,
to give drink to my people, my chosen. 
\v 21 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.
\p
\v 22 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of
me, O Israel. 
\v 23 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings;
neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to
serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. 
\v 24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled
me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy
sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. 
\v 25 I, \add even\add* I, \add am\add* he that blotteth out thy
transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. 
\v 26 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou
mayest be justified. 
\v 27 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against
me. 
\v 28 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given
Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.
\c 44
\p
\v 1 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen: 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, 
\add which\add* will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou,
Jesurun, whom I have chosen. 
\v 3 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry
ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine
offspring: 
\v 4 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water
courses. 
\v 5 One shall say, I \add am\add* the LORD’S; and another shall call 
\add himself\add* by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe 
\add with\add* his hand unto the LORD, and surname \add himself\add* by the
name of Israel. 
\v 6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of
hosts; I \add am\add* the first, and I \add am\add* the last; and beside me 
\add there is\add* no God. 
\v 7 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for
me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and
shall come, let them shew unto them. 
\v 8 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and
have declared \add it?\add* ye \add are\add* even my witnesses. Is there a God
beside me? yea, \add there is\add* no God; I know not \add any.\add*
\p
\v 9 They that make a graven image \add are\add* all of them vanity; and their
delectable things shall not profit; and they \add are\add* their own
witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed. 
\v 10 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image \add that\add* is
profitable for nothing? 
\v 11 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they 
\add are\add* of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; 
\add yet\add* they shall fear, \add and\add* they shall be ashamed together. 
\v 12 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it
with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry,
and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint. 
\v 13 The carpenter stretcheth out \add his\add* rule; he marketh it out with
a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and
maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it
may remain in the house. 
\v 14 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he
strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash,
and the rain doth nourish \add it. \add*
\v 15 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm
himself; yea, he kindleth \add it,\add* and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a
god, and worshippeth \add it;\add* he maketh it a graven image, and falleth
down thereto. 
\v 16 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh;
he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth \add himself,\add* and
saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire: 
\v 17 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, \add even\add* his graven
image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth \add it,\add* and prayeth unto
it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou \add art\add* my god. 
\v 18 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that
they cannot see; \add and\add* their hearts, that they cannot understand. 
\v 19 And none considereth in his heart, neither \add is there\add* knowledge
nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I
have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten 
\add it:\add* and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I
fall down to the stock of a tree? 
\v 20 He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he
cannot deliver his soul, nor say, \add Is there\add* not a lie in my right
hand?
\p
\v 21 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou \add art\add* my servant: I
have formed thee; thou \add art\add* my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be
forgotten of me. 
\v 22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a
cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee. 
\v 23 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done \add it:\add* shout, ye lower
parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and
every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in
Israel. 
\v 24 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the
womb, I \add am\add* the LORD that maketh all \add things;\add* that
stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by
myself; 
\v 25 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that
turneth wise \add men\add* backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish; 
\v 26 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of
his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the
cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places
thereof: 
\v 27 That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers: 
\v 28 That saith of Cyrus, \add He is\add* my shepherd, and shall perform all
my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple,
Thy foundation shall be laid.
\c 45
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have
holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to
open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut; 
\v 2 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I will break
in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron: 
\v 3 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of
secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the LORD, which call \add thee
\add* by thy name, \add am\add* the God of Israel. 
\v 4 For Jacob my servant’s sake, and Israel mine elect, I have even called
thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
\p
\v 5 I \add am\add* the LORD, and \add there is\add* none else, \add there is
\add* no God beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me: 
\v 6 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that 
\add there is\add* none beside me. I \add am\add* the LORD, and \add there is
\add* none else. 
\v 7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I
the LORD do all these \add things. \add*
\v 8 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let
righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it. 
\v 9 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! \add Let\add* the potsherd 
\add strive\add* with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him
that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? 
\v 10 Woe unto him that saith unto \add his\add* father, What begettest thou?
or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth? 
\v 11 Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of
things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command
ye me. 
\v 12 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, \add even\add* my
hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded. 
\v 13 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways:
he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor
reward, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 14 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of Ethiopia
and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall
be thine: they shall come after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they
shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, \add saying,
\add* Surely God \add is\add* in thee; and \add there is\add* none else, 
\add there is\add* no God. 
\v 15 Verily thou \add art\add* a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,
the Saviour. 
\v 16 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go
to confusion together \add that are\add* makers of idols. 
\v 17 \add But\add* Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end. 
\v 18 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself that
formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in
vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I \add am\add* the LORD; and \add there
is\add* none else. 
\v 19 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I said not
unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the LORD speak righteousness, I
declare things that are right.
\p
\v 20 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye \add that are
\add* escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the wood of
their graven image, and pray unto a god \add that\add* cannot save. 
\v 21 Tell ye, and bring \add them\add* near; yea, let them take counsel
together: who hath declared this from ancient time? \add who\add* hath told it
from that time? \add have\add* not I the LORD? and \add there is\add* no God
else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; \add there is\add* none beside me. 
\v 22 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I 
\add am\add* God, and \add there is\add* none else. 
\v 23 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth \add in
\add* righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow,
every tongue shall swear. 
\v 24 Surely, shall \add one\add* say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
strength: \add even\add* to him shall \add men\add* come; and all that are
incensed against him shall be ashamed. 
\v 25 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
\c 46
\p
\v 1 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and
upon the cattle: your carriages \add were\add* heavy loaden; \add they are
\add* a burden to the weary \add beast. \add*
\v 2 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden,
but themselves are gone into captivity. 
\v 3 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of
Israel, which are borne \add by me\add* from the belly, which are carried from
the womb: 
\v 4 And \add even\add* to \add your\add* old age I \add am\add* he; and 
\add even\add* to hoar hairs will I carry \add you:\add* I have made, and I
will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver \add you.\add*
\p
\v 5 To whom will ye liken me, and make \add me\add* equal, and compare me,
that we may be like? 
\v 6 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, 
\add and\add* hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they fall down, yea,
they worship. 
\v 7 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his
place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove: yea, \add one
\add* shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor save him out of his
trouble. 
\v 8 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to mind, O ye
transgressors. 
\v 9 Remember the former things of old: for I \add am\add* God, and 
\add there is\add* none else; \add I am\add* God, and \add there is
\add* none like me, 
\v 10 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times \add the
things\add* that are not \add yet\add* done, saying, My counsel shall stand,
and I will do all my pleasure: 
\v 11 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel
from a far country: yea, I have spoken \add it,\add* I will also bring it to
pass; I have purposed \add it,\add* I will also do it.
\p
\v 12 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that \add are\add* far from
righteousness: 
\v 13 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation
shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
\c 47
\p
\v 1 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the
ground: \add there is\add* no throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou
shalt no more be called tender and delicate. 
\v 2 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make bare the
leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers. 
\v 3 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen: I will
take vengeance, and I will not meet \add thee as\add* a man. 
\v 4 \add As for\add* our redeemer, the LORD of hosts \add is\add* his name,
the Holy One of Israel. 
\v 5 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans:
for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of kingdoms.
\p
\v 6 I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given
them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy; upon the ancient hast
thou very heavily laid thy yoke.
\p
\v 7 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: \add so\add* that thou didst
not lay these \add things\add* to thy heart, neither didst remember the latter
end of it. 
\v 8 Therefore hear now this, \add thou that art\add* given to pleasures, that
dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I \add am,\add* and none else
beside me; I shall not sit \add as\add* a widow, neither shall I know the loss
of children: 
\v 9 But these two \add things\add* shall come to thee in a moment in one day,
the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their
perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries, \add and\add* for the great
abundance of thine enchantments.
\p
\v 10 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None seeth me.
Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee; and thou hast said in
thine heart, I \add am,\add* and none else beside me.
\p
\v 11 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it
riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put if
off: and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly, \add which\add* thou shalt
not know. 
\v 12 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy
sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be
able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. 
\v 13 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save
thee from \add these things\add* that shall come upon thee. 
\v 14 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall
not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: \add there shall
\add* not \add be\add* a coal to warm at, \add nor\add* fire to sit before
it. 
\v 15 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, \add even
\add* thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every one to his
quarter; none shall save thee.
\c 48
\p
\v 1 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel,
and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the
LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, \add but\add* not in truth, nor
in righteousness. 
\v 2 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the
God of Israel; The LORD of hosts \add is\add* his name. 
\v 3 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth
out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did \add them\add* suddenly, and they
came to pass. 
\v 4 Because I knew that thou \add art\add* obstinate, and thy neck 
\add is\add* an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; 
\v 5 I have even from the beginning declared \add it\add* to thee; before it
came to pass I shewed \add it\add* thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol
hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded
them. 
\v 6 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare \add it?
\add* I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and
thou didst not know them. 
\v 7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day
when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. 
\v 8 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time 
\add that\add* thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal
very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.
\p
\v 9 For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I
refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. 
\v 10 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in
the furnace of affliction. 
\v 11 For mine own sake, \add even\add* for mine own sake, will I do 
\add it:\add* for how should \add my name\add* be polluted? and I will not
give my glory unto another.
\p
\v 12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I \add am\add* he; I 
\add am\add* the first, I also \add am\add* the last. 
\v 13 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand
hath spanned the heavens: \add when\add* I call unto them, they stand up
together. 
\v 14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared
these \add things?\add* The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on
Babylon, and his arm \add shall be on\add* the Chaldeans. 
\v 15 I, \add even\add* I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought
him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
\p
\v 16 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the
beginning; from the time that it was, there \add am\add* I: and now the Lord
GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me. 
\v 17 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I \add am
\add* the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by
the way \add that\add* thou shouldest go. 
\v 18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been
as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: 
\v 19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like
the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from
before me.
\p
\v 20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of
singing declare ye, tell this, utter it \add even\add* to the end of the
earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob. 
\v 21 And they thirsted not \add when\add* he led them through the deserts: he
caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also,
and the waters gushed out. 
\v 22 \add There is\add* no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.
\c 49
\p
\v 1 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far; The LORD hath
called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of
my name. 
\v 2 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand
hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver hath he hid me; 
\v 3 And said unto me, Thou \add art\add* my servant, O Israel, in whom I will
be glorified. 
\v 4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength for
nought, and in vain: \add yet\add* surely my judgment \add is\add* with the
LORD, and my work with my God.
\p
\v 5 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb \add to be
\add* his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered,
yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my
strength. 
\v 6 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to
raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will
also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation
unto the end of the earth. 
\v 7 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, \add and\add* his Holy One,
to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to a servant of
rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the
LORD that is faithful, \add and\add* the Holy One of Israel, and he shall
choose thee. 
\v 8 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a
day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee
for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the
desolate heritages; 
\v 9 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that \add are
\add* in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their
pastures \add shall be\add* in all high places. 
\v 10 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite
them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of
water shall he guide them. 
\v 11 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be
exalted. 
\v 12 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the north and
from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
\p
\v 13 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O
mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people, and will have mercy upon
his afflicted. 
\v 14 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath forgotten
me. 
\v 15 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget
thee. 
\v 16 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of \add my\add* hands; thy
walls \add are\add* continually before me. 
\v 17 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that made thee
waste shall go forth of thee.
\p
\v 18 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves
together, \add and\add* come to thee. \add As\add* I live, saith the LORD,
thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an ornament, and bind
them \add on thee,\add* as a bride \add doeth. \add*
\v 19 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy destruction,
shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that
swallowed thee up shall be far away. 
\v 20 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the other,
shall say again in thine ears, The place \add is\add* too strait for me: give
place to me that I may dwell. 
\v 21 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me these, seeing I
have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro?
and who hath brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where 
\add had\add* they \add been? \add*
\v 22 Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the
Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring thy sons
in \add their\add* arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon \add their
\add* shoulders. 
\v 23 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing
mothers: they shall bow down to thee with \add their\add* face toward the
earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I 
\add am\add* the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.
\p
\v 24 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
delivered? 
\v 25 But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken
away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with
him that contendeth with thee, and I will save thy children. 
\v 26 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they
shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall
know that I the LORD \add am\add* thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One
of Jacob.
\c 50
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the LORD, Where \add is\add* the bill of your mother’s
divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors \add is it
\add* to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold
yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away. 
\v 2 Wherefore, when I came, \add was there\add* no man? when I called, 
\add was there\add* none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it
cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up
the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stinketh, because 
\add there is\add* no water, and dieth for thirst. 
\v 3 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their
covering. 
\v 4 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know
how to speak a word in season to \add him that is\add* weary: he wakeneth
morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned.
\p
\v 5 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious, neither
turned away back. 
\v 6 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the
hair: I hid not my face from shame and spitting.
\p
\v 7 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be confounded:
therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be
ashamed. 
\v 8 \add He is\add* near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let us
stand together: who \add is\add* mine adversary? let him come near to me. 
\v 9 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who \add is\add* he \add that
\add* shall condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth
shall eat them up.
\p
\v 10 Who \add is\add* among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
of his servant, that walketh \add in\add* darkness, and hath no light? let him
trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God. 
\v 11 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass \add yourselves
\add* about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks 
\add that\add* ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand; ye shall lie
down in sorrow.
\c 51
\p
\v 1 Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the LORD:
look unto the rock \add whence\add* ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit 
\add whence\add* ye are digged. 
\v 2 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah \add that\add* bare you:
for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him. 
\v 3 For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places;
and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of
the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice
of melody.
\p
\v 4 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation: for a law
shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the
people. 
\v 5 My righteousness \add is\add* near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and on mine arm
shall they trust. 
\v 6 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath: for
the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a
garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my
salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.
\p
\v 7 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart 
\add is\add* my law; fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye afraid of
their revilings. 
\v 8 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat
them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from
generation to generation.
\p
\v 9 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the
ancient days, in the generations of old. \add Art\add* thou not it that hath
cut Rahab, \add and\add* wounded the dragon? 
\v 10 \add Art\add* thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the
great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to
pass over? 
\v 11 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing
unto Zion; and everlasting joy \add shall be\add* upon their head: they shall
obtain gladness and joy; \add and\add* sorrow and mourning shall flee away. 
\v 12 I, \add even\add* I, \add am\add* he that comforteth you: who 
\add art\add* thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man \add that
\add* shall die, and of the son of man \add which\add* shall be made as
grass; 
\v 13 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth the
heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast feared continually
every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to
destroy? and where \add is\add* the fury of the oppressor? 
\v 14 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he should
not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail. 
\v 15 But I \add am\add* the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
roared: The LORD of hosts \add is\add* his name. 
\v 16 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee in the
shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of
the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou \add art\add* my people.
\p
\v 17 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the
LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling,
\add and\add* wrung \add them\add* out. 
\v 18 \add There is\add* none to guide her among all the sons \add whom
\add* she hath brought forth; neither \add is there any\add* that taketh her
by the hand of all the sons \add that\add* she hath brought up. 
\v 19 These two \add things\add* are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for
thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom
shall I comfort thee? 
\v 20 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a
wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of thy
God.
\p
\v 21 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not with
wine: 
\v 22 Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God \add that\add* pleadeth the
cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of
trembling, \add even\add* the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more
drink it again: 
\v 23 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; which have
said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body
as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.
\c 52
\p
\v 1 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments,
O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee
the uncircumcised and the unclean. 
\v 2 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, \add and\add* sit down, O Jerusalem:
loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion. 
\v 3 For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall
be redeemed without money. 
\v 4 For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to
sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause. 
\v 5 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken
away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD;
and my name continually every day is blasphemed. 
\v 6 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore \add they shall know
\add* in that day that I \add am\add* he that doth speak: behold, \add it is
\add* I.
\p
\v 7 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good
tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that
publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth! 
\v 8 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they
sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.
\p
\v 9 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for
the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem. 
\v 10 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and
all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.
\p
\v 11 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean 
\add thing;\add* go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the
vessels of the LORD. 
\v 12 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will
go before you; and the God of Israel \add will be\add* your rereward.
\p
\v 13 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and
extolled, and be very high. 
\v 14 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any
man, and his form more than the sons of men: 
\v 15 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at
him: for \add that\add* which had not been told them shall they see; and 
\add that\add* which they had not heard shall they consider.
\c 53
\p
\v 1 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD
revealed? 
\v 2 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a
dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, 
\add there is\add* no beauty that we should desire him. 
\v 3 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with
grief: and we hid as it were \add our\add* faces from him; he was despised,
and we esteemed him not.
\p
\v 4 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did
esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. 
\v 5 But he \add was\add* wounded for our transgressions, \add he was
\add* bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace \add was
\add* upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. 
\v 6 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own
way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. 
\v 7 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he
is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is
dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. 
\v 8 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his
generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the
transgression of my people was he stricken. 
\v 9 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death;
because he had done no violence, neither \add was any\add* deceit in his
mouth.
\p
\v 10 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put \add him\add* to
grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see 
\add his\add* seed, he shall prolong \add his\add* days, and the pleasure of
the LORD shall prosper in his hand. 
\v 11 He shall see of the travail of his soul, \add and\add* shall be
satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he
shall bear their iniquities. 
\v 12 Therefore will I divide him \add a portion\add* with the great, and he
shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul
unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of
many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
\c 54
\p
\v 1 Sing, O barren, thou \add that\add* didst not bear; break forth into
singing, and cry aloud, thou \add that\add* didst not travail with child: for
more \add are\add* the children of the desolate than the children of the
married wife, saith the LORD. 
\v 2 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of
thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes; 
\v 3 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy
seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be
inhabited. 
\v 4 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for
thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth,
and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. 
\v 5 For thy Maker \add is\add* thine husband; the LORD of hosts \add is
\add* his name; and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole
earth shall he be called. 
\v 6 For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit,
and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith thy God. 
\v 7 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I
gather thee. 
\v 8 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with
everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the LORD thy Redeemer. 
\v 9 For this \add is as\add* the waters of Noah unto me: for \add as
\add* I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth;
so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee. 
\v 10 For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my
kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be
removed, saith the LORD that hath mercy on thee.
\p
\v 11 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, \add and\add* not comforted,
behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and lay thy foundations with
sapphires. 
\v 12 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of carbuncles, and
all thy borders of pleasant stones. 
\v 13 And all thy children \add shall be\add* taught of the LORD; and great 
\add shall be\add* the peace of thy children. 
\v 14 In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from
oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for it shall not come
near thee. 
\v 15 Behold, they shall surely gather together, \add but\add* not by me:
whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake. 
\v 16 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and
that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the waster
to destroy.
\p
\v 17 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue 
\add that\add* shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This 
\add is\add* the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and their righteousness
\add is\add* of me, saith the LORD.
\c 55
\p
\v 1 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no
money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and
without price. 
\v 2 Wherefore do ye spend money for \add that which is\add* not bread? and
your labour for \add that which\add* satisfieth not? hearken diligently unto
me, and eat ye \add that which is\add* good, and let your soul delight itself
in fatness. 
\v 3 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I
will make an everlasting covenant with you, \add even\add* the sure mercies of
David. 
\v 4 Behold, I have given him \add for\add* a witness to the people, a leader
and commander to the people. 
\v 5 Behold, thou shalt call a nation \add that\add* thou knowest not, and
nations \add that\add* knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the LORD
thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath glorified thee.
\p
\v 6 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is
near: 
\v 7 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and
let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God,
for he will abundantly pardon.
\p
\v 8 For my thoughts \add are\add* not your thoughts, neither \add are
\add* your ways my ways, saith the LORD. 
\v 9 For \add as\add* the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. 
\v 10 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not
thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it
may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater: 
\v 11 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not
return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall
prosper \add in the thing\add* whereto I sent it. 
\v 12 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains
and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of
the field shall clap \add their\add* hands. 
\v 13 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the
brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name,
for an everlasting sign \add that\add* shall not be cut off.
\c 56
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation 
\add is\add* near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. 
\v 2 Blessed \add is\add* the man \add that\add* doeth this, and the son of
man \add that\add* layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting
it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.
\p
\v 3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the
LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people:
neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I \add am\add* a dry tree. 
\v 4 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and
choose \add the things\add* that please me, and take hold of my covenant; 
\v 5 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and
a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting
name, that shall not be cut off. 
\v 6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve
him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that
keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant; 
\v 7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my
house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices \add shall be
\add* accepted upon mine altar; for mine house shall be called an house of
prayer for all people. 
\v 8 The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I
gather \add others\add* to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.
\p
\v 9 All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, \add yea,\add* all ye beasts
in the forest. 
\v 10 His watchmen \add are\add* blind: they are all ignorant, they 
\add are\add* all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to
slumber. 
\v 11 Yea, \add they are\add* greedy dogs \add which\add* can never have
enough, and they \add are\add* shepherds \add that\add* cannot understand:
they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter. 
\v 12 Come ye, \add say they,\add* I will fetch wine, and we will fill
ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this day, \add and
\add* much more abundant.
\c 57
\p
\v 1 The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth \add it\add* to heart: and
merciful men \add are\add* taken away, none considering that the righteous is
taken away from the evil \add to come. \add*
\v 2 He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, \add each one
\add* walking \add in\add* his uprightness.
\p
\v 3 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer
and the whore. 
\v 4 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, 
\add and\add* draw out the tongue? \add are\add* ye not children of
transgression, a seed of falsehood, 
\v 5 Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the
children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks? 
\v 6 Among the smooth \add stones\add* of the stream \add is\add* thy portion;
they, they \add are\add* thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink
offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive comfort in
these? 
\v 7 Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even thither
wentest thou up to offer sacrifice. 
\v 8 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for
thou hast discovered \add thyself to another\add* than me, and art gone up;
thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee \add a covenant\add* with them; thou
lovedst their bed where thou sawest \add it. \add*
\v 9 And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy
perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase \add thyself
even\add* unto hell. 
\v 10 Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; \add yet\add* saidst thou
not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand; therefore thou
wast not grieved. 
\v 11 And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast lied, and
hast not remembered me, nor laid \add it\add* to thy heart? have not I held my
peace even of old, and thou fearest me not? 
\v 12 I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not
profit thee.
\p
\v 13 When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind shall
carry them all away; vanity shall take \add them:\add* but he that putteth his
trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain; 
\v 14 And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the
stumblingblock out of the way of my people. 
\v 15 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose
name \add is\add* Holy; I dwell in the high and holy \add place,\add* with him
also \add that is\add* of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit
of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. 
\v 16 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the
spirit should fail before me, and the souls \add which\add* I have made. 
\v 17 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid
me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart. 
\v 18 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and
restore comforts unto him and to his mourners. 
\v 19 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to \add him that is
\add* far off, and to \add him that is\add* near, saith the LORD; and I will
heal him. 
\v 20 But the wicked \add are\add* like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
whose waters cast up mire and dirt. 
\v 21 \add There is\add* no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
\c 58
\p
\v 1 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my
people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sins. 
\v 2 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a nation that did
righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God: they ask of me the
ordinances of justice; they take delight in approaching to God.
\p
\v 3 Wherefore have we fasted, \add say they,\add* and thou seest not? 
\add wherefore\add* have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge?
Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact all your labours.
\v 4 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of
wickedness: ye shall not fast as \add ye do this\add* day, to make your voice
to be heard on high. 
\v 5 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his
soul? \add is it\add* to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread
sackcloth and ashes \add under him?\add* wilt thou call this a fast, and an
acceptable day to the LORD? 
\v 6 \add Is\add* not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of
wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and
that ye break every yoke? 
\v 7 \add Is it\add* not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring
the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou
cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
\p
\v 8 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall
spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory
of the LORD shall be thy rereward. 
\v 9 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt cry, and he
shall say, Here I \add am.\add* If thou take away from the midst of thee the
yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking vanity; 
\v 10 And \add if\add* thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness 
\add be\add* as the noonday: 
\v 11 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in
drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and
like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. 
\v 12 And \add they that shall be\add* of thee shall build the old waste
places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou
shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell
in.
\p
\v 13 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, \add from\add* doing thy
pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD,
honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine
own pleasure, nor speaking \add thine own\add* words: 
\v 14 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause thee to
ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of
Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken \add it.\add*
\c 59
\p
\v 1 Behold, the LORD’S hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither
his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: 
\v 2 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your
sins have hid \add his\add* face from you, that he will not hear. 
\v 3 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity;
your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath muttered perverseness. 
\v 4 None calleth for justice, nor \add any\add* pleadeth for truth: they
trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth
iniquity. 
\v 5 They hatch cockatrice’ eggs, and weave the spider’s web: he that eateth
of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. 
\v 6 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves
with their works: their works \add are\add* works of iniquity, and the act of
violence \add is\add* in their hands. 
\v 7 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their
thoughts \add are\add* thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction 
\add are\add* in their paths. 
\v 8 The way of peace they know not; and \add there is\add* no judgment in
their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever goeth therein shall
not know peace.
\p
\v 9 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice overtake us: we
wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, \add but\add* we walk in
darkness. 
\v 10 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if \add we had
\add* no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the night; \add we are\add* in
desolate places as dead \add men. \add*
\v 11 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment,
but \add there is\add* none; for salvation, \add but\add* it is far off from
us. 
\v 12 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify
against us: for our transgressions \add are\add* with us; and \add as for
\add* our iniquities, we know them; 
\v 13 In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing away from our
God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart
words of falsehood. 
\v 14 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth afar off: for
truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter. 
\v 15 Yea, truth faileth; and he \add that\add* departeth from evil maketh
himself a prey: and the LORD saw \add it,\add* and it displeased him that 
\add there was\add* no judgment.
\p
\v 16 And he saw that \add there was\add* no man, and wondered that 
\add there was\add* no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto
him; and his righteousness, it sustained him. 
\v 17 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of salvation
upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance \add for\add* clothing,
and was clad with zeal as a cloke. 
\v 18 According to \add their\add* deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to
his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will repay
recompence. 
\v 19 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory
from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the
Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.
\p
\v 20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from
transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD. 
\v 21 As for me, this \add is\add* my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My
spirit that \add is\add* upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed,
nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and
for ever.
\c 60
\p
\v 1 Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen
upon thee. 
\v 2 For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the
people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon
thee. 
\v 3 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of
thy rising. 
\v 4 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather themselves
together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters
shall be nursed at \add thy\add* side. 
\v 5 Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall fear, and
be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee,
the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. 
\v 6 The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and
Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and
they shall shew forth the praises of the LORD. 
\v 7 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of
Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come up with acceptance on mine
altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory. 
\v 8 Who \add are\add* these \add that\add* fly as a cloud, and as the doves
to their windows? 
\v 9 Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish first, to
bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name
of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy One of Israel, because he hath glorified
thee. 
\v 10 And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings
shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my favour have
I had mercy on thee. 
\v 11 Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut
day nor night; that \add men\add* may bring unto thee the forces of the
Gentiles, and \add that\add* their kings \add may be\add* brought. 
\v 12 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish; yea, 
\add those\add* nations shall be utterly wasted. 
\v 13 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree,
and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will make
the place of my feet glorious. 
\v 14 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee;
and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy
feet; and they shall call thee, The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One
of Israel. 
\v 15 Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through 
\add thee,\add* I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many
generations. 
\v 16 Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast
of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD \add am\add* thy Saviour and thy
Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob. 
\v 17 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for
wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy officers peace, and
thine exactors righteousness. 
\v 18 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction
within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Salvation, and thy gates
Praise. 
\v 19 The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall
the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD shall be unto thee an everlasting
light, and thy God thy glory. 
\v 20 Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself:
for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning
shall be ended. 
\v 21 Thy people also \add shall be\add* all righteous: they shall inherit the
land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be
glorified. 
\v 22 A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong nation: I
the LORD will hasten it in his time.
\c 61
\p
\v 1 The Spirit of the Lord GOD \add is\add* upon me; because the LORD hath
anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up
the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the
prison to \add them that are\add* bound; 
\v 2 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of
our God; to comfort all that mourn; 
\v 3 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for
ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of
heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of
the LORD, that he might be glorified.
\p
\v 4 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former
desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many
generations. 
\v 5 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien
\add shall be\add* your plowmen and your vinedressers. 
\v 6 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: \add men\add* shall call
you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in
their glory shall ye boast yourselves.
\p
\v 7 For your shame \add ye shall have\add* double; and \add for\add*
confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they
shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them. 
\v 8 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I
will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with
them. 
\v 9 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring
among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they 
\add are\add* the seed \add which\add* the LORD hath blessed. 
\v 10 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God;
for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with
the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh \add himself\add* with
ornaments, and as a bride adorneth \add herself\add* with her jewels. 
\v 11 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the
things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause
righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
\c 62
\p
\v 1 For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will
not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the
salvation thereof as a lamp \add that\add* burneth. 
\v 2 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory:
and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall
name. 
\v 3 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal
diadem in the hand of thy God. 
\v 4 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be
termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for
the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
\p
\v 5 For \add as\add* a young man marrieth a virgin, \add so\add* shall thy
sons marry thee: and \add as\add* the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, 
\add so\add* shall thy God rejoice over thee. 
\v 6 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, \add which\add* shall
never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep
not silence, 
\v 7 And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a
praise in the earth. 
\v 8 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,
Surely I will no more give thy corn \add to be\add* meat for thine enemies;
and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast
laboured: 
\v 9 But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and
they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my
holiness.
\p
\v 10 Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast
up, cast up the highways; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the
people. 
\v 11 Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to
the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward 
\add is\add* with him, and his work before him. 
\v 12 And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and
thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.
\c 63
\p
\v 1 Who \add is\add* this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
Bozrah? this \add that is\add* glorious in his apparel, travelling in the
greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save. 
\v 2 Wherefore \add art thou\add* red in thine apparel, and thy garments like
him that treadeth in the winefat? 
\v 3 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people \add there was
\add* none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in
my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain
all my raiment. 
\v 4 For the day of vengeance \add is\add* in mine heart, and the year of my
redeemed is come. 
\v 5 And I looked, and \add there was\add* none to help; and I wondered that 
\add there was\add* none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation
unto me; and my fury, it upheld me. 
\v 6 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my
fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.
\p
\v 7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, \add and\add* the
praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and
the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on them
according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his
lovingkindnesses. 
\v 8 For he said, Surely they \add are\add* my people, children \add that
\add* will not lie: so he was their Saviour. 
\v 9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence
saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them,
and carried them all the days of old.
\p
\v 10 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was turned to
be their enemy, \add and\add* he fought against them. 
\v 11 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, \add and\add* his people, 
\add saying,\add* Where \add is\add* he that brought them up out of the sea
with the shepherd of his flock? where \add is\add* he that put his holy Spirit
within him? 
\v 12 That led \add them\add* by the right hand of Moses with his glorious
arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name? 
\v 13 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, 
\add that\add* they should not stumble? 
\v 14 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD caused him
to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
\p
\v 15 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness
and of thy glory: where \add is\add* thy zeal and thy strength, the sounding
of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained? 
\v 16 Doubtless thou \add art\add* our father, though Abraham be ignorant of
us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, \add art\add* our father, our
redeemer; thy name \add is\add* from everlasting.
\p
\v 17 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, \add and\add*
hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the tribes of
thine inheritance. 
\v 18 The people of thy holiness have possessed \add it\add* but a little
while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary. 
\v 19 We are \add thine:\add* thou never barest rule over them; they were not
called by thy name.
\c 64
\p
\v 1 Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down,
that the mountains might flow down at thy presence, 
\v 2 As \add when\add* the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters
to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, \add that\add* the
nations may tremble at thy presence! 
\v 3 When thou didst terrible things \add which\add* we looked not for, thou
camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence. 
\v 4 For since the beginning of the world \add men\add* have not heard, nor
perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, 
\add what\add* he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him. 
\v 5 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, \add those
that\add* remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have
sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved. 
\v 6 But we are all as an unclean \add thing,\add* and all our righteousnesses
\add are\add* as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our
iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away. 
\v 7 And \add there is\add* none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up
himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast
consumed us, because of our iniquities. 
\v 8 But now, O LORD, thou \add art\add* our father; we \add are\add* the
clay, and thou our potter; and we all \add are\add* the work of thy hand.
\p
\v 9 Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever:
behold, see, we beseech thee, we \add are\add* all thy people. 
\v 10 Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a
desolation. 
\v 11 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is
burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste. 
\v 12 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these \add things,\add* O LORD? wilt thou
hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
\c 65
\p
\v 1 I am sought of \add them that\add* asked not \add for me;\add* I am found
of \add them that\add* sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a
nation \add that\add* was not called by my name. 
\v 2 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which
walketh in a way \add that was\add* not good, after their own thoughts; 
\v 3 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that
sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick; 
\v 4 Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which eat
swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable \add things is in\add* their vessels; 
\v 5 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am holier than
thou. \add These\add* are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all the
day. 
\v 6 Behold, \add it is\add* written before me: I will not keep silence, but
will recompense, even recompense into their bosom, 
\v 7 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the
LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the
hills: therefore will I measure their former work into their bosom.
\p
\v 8 Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and 
\add one\add* saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing \add is\add* in it: so
will I do for my servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all. 
\v 9 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor
of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell
there. 
\v 10 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place
for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
\p
\v 11 But ye \add are\add* they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy
mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the drink
offering unto that number. 
\v 12 Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to
the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I spake, ye did
not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose \add that\add* wherein
I delighted not. 
\v 13 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye
shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty:
behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: 
\v 14 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for
sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit. 
\v 15 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for the Lord
GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name: 
\v 16 That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God
of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the God of truth;
because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from mine
eyes.
\p
\v 17 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the former shall
not be remembered, nor come into mind. 
\v 18 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever \add in that\add* which I create:
for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy. 
\v 19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the voice of
weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 
\v 20 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man that
hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years old; but
the sinner \add being\add* an hundred years old shall be accursed. 
\v 21 And they shall build houses, and inhabit \add them;\add* and they shall
plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. 
\v 22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and
another eat: for as the days of a tree \add are\add* the days of my people,
and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands. 
\v 23 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for they 
\add are\add* the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with
them. 
\v 24 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and
while they are yet speaking, I will hear. 
\v 25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw
like the bullock: and dust \add shall be\add* the serpent’s meat. They shall
not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.
\c 66
\p
\v 1 Thus saith the LORD, The heaven \add is\add* my throne, and the earth 
\add is\add* my footstool: where \add is\add* the house that ye build unto me?
and where \add is\add* the place of my rest? 
\v 2 For all those \add things\add* hath mine hand made, and all those 
\add things\add* have been, saith the LORD: but to this \add man\add* will I
look, \add even\add* to \add him that is\add* poor and of a contrite spirit,
and trembleth at my word. 
\v 3 He that killeth an ox \add is as if\add* he slew a man; he that
sacrificeth a lamb, \add as if\add* he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offereth
an oblation, \add as if he offered\add* swine’s blood; he that burneth
incense, \add as if\add* he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own
ways, and their soul delighteth in their abominations. 
\v 4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them;
because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but
they did evil before mine eyes, and chose \add that\add* in which I delighted
not.
\p
\v 5 Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; your brethren
that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, Let the LORD be
glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed. 
\v 6 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the
LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies. 
\v 7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was
delivered of a man child. 
\v 8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall the earth
be made to bring forth in one day? \add or\add* shall a nation be born at
once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children. 
\v 9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith the LORD:
shall I cause to bring forth, and shut \add the womb?\add* saith thy God. 
\v 10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her:
rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: 
\v 11 That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations;
that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. 
\v 12 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a
river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall ye
suck, ye shall be borne upon \add her\add* sides, and be dandled upon 
\add her\add* knees. 
\v 13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and ye shall
be comforted in Jerusalem. 
\v 14 And when ye see \add this,\add* your heart shall rejoice, and your bones
shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward
his servants, and \add his\add* indignation toward his enemies. 
\v 15 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a
whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
\v 16 For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the
slain of the LORD shall be many. 
\v 17 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens
behind one \add tree\add* in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the
abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the LORD. 
\v 18 For I \add know\add* their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that
I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
\v 19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of
them unto the nations, \add to\add* Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow,
\add to\add* Tubal, and Javan, \add to\add* the isles afar off, that have not
heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory
among the Gentiles. 
\v 20 And they shall bring all your brethren \add for\add* an offering unto
the LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and
upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the
LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the
house of the LORD. 
\v 21 And I will also take of them for priests \add and\add* for Levites,
saith the LORD. 
\v 22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall
remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain. 
\v 23 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* from one new moon to another,
and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me,
saith the LORD. 
\v 24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men that have
transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their
fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
