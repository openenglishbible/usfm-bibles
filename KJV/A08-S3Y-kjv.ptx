\mt The Prayer of Azariah 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the
Lord.
\p
\v 2 Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth
in the midst of the fire said,
\p
\v 3 Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be
praised and glorified for evermore:
\p
\v 4 For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea,
true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.
\p
\v 5 In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city
of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for
according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us
because of our sins.
\p
\v 6 For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.
\p
\v 7 In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor
kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with
us.
\p
\v 8 Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou
hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.
\p
\v 9 And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful
forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the
world.
\p
\v 10 And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to
thy servants; and to them that worship thee.
\p
\v 11 Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name’s sake, neither disannul thou
thy covenant:
\p
\v 12 And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham’s
sake, for thy servant Issac’s sake, and for thy holy Israel’s sake;
\p
\v 13 To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their
seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.
\p
\v 14 For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this
day in all the world because of our sins.
\p
\v 15 Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt
offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before
thee, and to find mercy.
\p
\v 16 Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be
accepted.
\p
\v 17 Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten
thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and
grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that
put their trust in thee.
\p
\v 18 And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy
face.
\p
\v 19 Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and
according to the multitude of thy mercies.
\p
\v 20 Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy
name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;
\p
\v 21 And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their
strength be broken;
\p
\v 22 And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the
whole world.
\p
\v 23 And the king’s servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven
hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;
\p
\v 24 So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine
cubits.
\p
\v 25 And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the
furnace.
\p
\v 26 But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias
and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven;
\p
\v 27 And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind,
so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.
\p
\v 28 Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed,
God in the furnace, saying,
\p
\v 29 Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and
exalted above all for ever.
\p
\v 30 And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted
above all for ever.
\p
\v 31 Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised
and glorified above all for ever.
\p
\v 32 Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the
cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
\p
\v 33 Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be
praised and glorified above all for ever.
\p
\v 34 Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above all to be praised
and glorified for ever.
