\h Exodus
\mt The Second Book of Moses, called Exodus 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the names of the children of Israel, which came
into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. 
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, 
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, 
\v 4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
\v 5 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls:
for Joseph was in Egypt \add already. \add*
\v 6 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
\p
\v 7 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and
multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. 
\v 8 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph. 
\v 9 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel
\add are\add* more and mightier than we: 
\v 10 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come
to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our
enemies, and fight against us, and \add so\add* get them up out of the land. 
\v 11 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their
burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. 
\v 12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And
they were grieved because of the children of Israel. 
\v 13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: 
\v 14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in
brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein
they made them serve, \add was\add* with rigour.
\p
\v 15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of
the one \add was\add* Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: 
\v 16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and
see \add them\add* upon the stools; if it \add be\add* a son, then ye shall
kill him: but if it \add be\add* a daughter, then she shall live. 
\v 17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded
them, but saved the men children alive. 
\v 18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why
have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? 
\v 19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women \add are
\add* not as the Egyptian women; for they \add are\add* lively, and are
delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. 
\v 20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied,
and waxed very mighty. 
\v 21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them
houses. 
\v 22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye
shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took \add to wife
\add* a daughter of Levi. 
\v 2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he 
\add was a\add* goodly \add child,\add* she hid him three months. 
\v 3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of
bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein;
and she laid \add it\add* in the flags by the river’s brink. 
\v 4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.
\p
\v 5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash \add herself\add* at the
river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the
ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 
\v 6 And when she had opened \add it,\add* she saw the child: and, behold, the
babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This \add is one
\add* of the Hebrews’ children. 
\v 7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a
nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 
\v 8 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the
child’s mother. 
\v 9 And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it
for me, and I will give \add thee\add* thy wages. And the woman took the
child, and nursed it. 
\v 10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he
became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew
him out of the water.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went
out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian
smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. 
\v 12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that \add there
was\add* no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 
\v 13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews
strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou
thy fellow? 
\v 14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou
to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely
this thing is known. 
\v 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses
fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat
down by a well. 
\v 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew 
\add water,\add* and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 
\v 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and
helped them, and watered their flock. 
\v 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How \add is it that
\add* ye are come so soon to day? 
\v 19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
shepherds, and also drew \add water\add* enough for us, and watered the
flock. 
\v 20 And he said unto his daughters, And where \add is\add* he? why 
\add is\add* it \add that\add* ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat
bread. 
\v 21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah
his daughter. 
\v 22 And she bare \add him\add* a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
\p
\v 23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and
the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and
their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. 
\v 24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with
Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. 
\v 25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto 
\add them.\add*
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of
Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the
mountain of God, \add even\add* to Horeb. 
\v 2 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the
midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and
the bush \add was\add* not consumed. 
\v 3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the
bush is not burnt. 
\v 4 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him
out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here 
\add am\add* I. 
\v 5 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet,
for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground. 
\v 6 Moreover he said, I \add am\add* the God of thy father, the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for
he was afraid to look upon God.
\p
\v 7 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which 
\add are\add* in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their
taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 
\v 8 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and
to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land
flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the
Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
Jebusites. 
\v 9 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me:
and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them. 
\v 10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
\p
\v 11 And Moses said unto God, Who \add am\add* I, that I should go unto
Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 
\v 12 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this \add shall be
\add* a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth
the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. 
\v 13 And Moses said unto God, Behold, \add when\add* I come unto the children
of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto
you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? 
\v 14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou
say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you. 
\v 15 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children
of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this \add is\add* my name for
ever, and this \add is\add* my memorial unto all generations. 
\v 16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The
LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared
unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and \add seen\add* that which is
done to you in Egypt: 
\v 17 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto
the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk
and honey. 
\v 18 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the
elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD
God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three
days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.
\p
\v 19 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a
mighty hand. 
\v 20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders
which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. 
\v 21 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it
shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: 
\v 22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:
and ye shall put \add them\add* upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and
ye shall spoil the Egyptians.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor
hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto
thee. 
\v 2 And the LORD said unto him, What \add is\add* that in thine hand? And he
said, A rod. 
\v 3 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it
became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it. 
\v 4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the
tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his
hand: 
\v 5 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.
\p
\v 6 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy
bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold,
his hand \add was\add* leprous as snow. 
\v 7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand
into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was
turned again as his \add other\add* flesh. 
\v 8 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken
to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter
sign. 
\v 9 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs,
neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the
river, and pour \add it\add* upon the dry \add land:\add* and the water which
thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry \add land.
\add*
\p
\v 10 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my Lord, I \add am\add* not eloquent,
neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I 
\add am\add* slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. 
\v 11 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? or who maketh the
dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD? 
\v 12 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou
shalt say. 
\v 13 And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand \add of him whom
\add* thou wilt send. 
\v 14 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, 
\add Is\add* not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well.
And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he
will be glad in his heart. 
\v 15 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be
with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. 
\v 16 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, 
\add even\add* he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to
him instead of God. 
\v 17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do
signs.
\p
\v 18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto
him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which \add are
\add* in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses,
Go in peace. 
\v 19 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all
the men are dead which sought thy life. 
\v 20 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he
returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand. 
\v 21 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see
that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand:
but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. 
\v 22 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel \add is
\add* my son, \add even\add* my firstborn: 
\v 23 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou
refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, \add even\add* thy
firstborn.
\p
\v 24 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and
sought to kill him. 
\v 25 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son,
and cast \add it\add* at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband 
\add art\add* thou to me. 
\v 26 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband \add thou art,
\add* because of the circumcision.
\p
\v 27 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he
went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. 
\v 28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all
the signs which he had commanded him.
\p
\v 29 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the
children of Israel: 
\v 30 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and
did the signs in the sight of the people. 
\v 31 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited
the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then
they bowed their heads and worshipped.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the
LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in
the wilderness. 
\v 2 And Pharaoh said, Who \add is\add* the LORD, that I should obey his voice
to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. 
\v 3 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we
pray thee, three days’ journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD
our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. 
\v 4 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron,
let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens. 
\v 5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now \add are\add* many,
and ye make them rest from their burdens. 
\v 6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and
their officers, saying, 
\v 7 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let
them go and gather straw for themselves. 
\v 8 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay
upon them; ye shall not diminish \add ought\add* thereof: for they \add be
\add* idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go \add and\add* sacrifice to
our God. 
\v 9 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein;
and let them not regard vain words.
\p
\v 10 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they
spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. 
\v 11 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work
shall be diminished. 
\v 12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to
gather stubble instead of straw. 
\v 13 And the taskmasters hasted \add them,\add* saying, Fulfil your works, 
\add your\add* daily tasks, as when there was straw. 
\v 14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh’s taskmasters
had set over them, were beaten, \add and\add* demanded, Wherefore have ye not
fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?
\p
\v 15 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh,
saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants? 
\v 16 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make
brick: and, behold, thy servants \add are\add* beaten; but the fault 
\add is\add* in thine own people. 
\v 17 But he said, Ye \add are\add* idle, \add ye are\add* idle: therefore ye
say, Let us go \add and\add* do sacrifice to the LORD. 
\v 18 Go therefore now, \add and\add* work; for there shall no straw be given
you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks. 
\v 19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see \add that\add* they 
\add were\add* in evil \add case,\add* after it was said, Ye shall not minish
\add ought\add* from your bricks of your daily task.
\p
\v 20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth
from Pharaoh: 
\v 21 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye
have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of
his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us. 
\v 22 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou 
\add so\add* evil entreated this people? why \add is\add* it \add that
\add* thou hast sent me? 
\v 23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to
this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to
Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand
shall he drive them out of his land. 
\v 2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I \add am\add* the LORD: 
\v 3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by \add the name
of\add* God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 
\v 4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land
of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. 
\v 5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the
Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant. 
\v 6 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I \add am\add* the LORD, and I
will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you
out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with
great judgments: 
\v 7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and
ye shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD your God, which bringeth you out
from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
\v 8 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear
to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an
heritage: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 9 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not
unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage. 
\v 10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 11 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of
Israel go out of his land. 
\v 12 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel
have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who \add am
\add* of uncircumcised lips? 
\v 13 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge
unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the
children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 14 These \add be\add* the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of
Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these 
\add be\add* the families of Reuben. 
\v 15 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and
Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these \add are\add* the
families of Simeon.
\p
\v 16 And these \add are\add* the names of the sons of Levi according to their
generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of
Levi \add were\add* an hundred thirty and seven years. 
\v 17 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families. 
\v 18 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and
the years of the life of Kohath \add were\add* an hundred thirty and three
years. 
\v 19 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these \add are\add* the
families of Levi according to their generations. 
\v 20 And Amram took him Jochebed his father’s sister to wife; and she bare
him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram \add were\add* an
hundred and thirty and seven years.
\p
\v 21 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri. 
\v 22 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri. 
\v 23 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon,
to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 24 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these 
\add are\add* the families of the Korhites. 
\v 25 And Eleazar Aaron’s son took him \add one\add* of the daughters of
Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these \add are\add* the heads of
the fathers of the Levites according to their families. 
\v 26 These \add are\add* that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring
out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. 
\v 27 These \add are\add* they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring
out the children of Israel from Egypt: these \add are\add* that Moses and
Aaron.
\p
\v 28 And it came to pass on the day \add when\add* the LORD spake unto Moses
in the land of Egypt, 
\v 29 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I \add am\add* the LORD: speak
thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee. 
\v 30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I \add am\add* of uncircumcised
lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?
\c 7
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and
Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 
\v 2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall
speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 
\v 3 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders
in the land of Egypt. 
\v 4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon
Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, \add and\add* my people the children of
Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments. 
\v 5 And the Egyptians shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD, when I stretch
forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among
them. 
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. 
\v 7 And Moses \add was\add* fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and
three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.
\p
\v 8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then
thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast \add it\add* before Pharaoh,
\add and\add* it shall become a serpent.
\p
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD
had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his
servants, and it became a serpent. 
\v 11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 
\v 12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but
Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods. 
\v 13 And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the
LORD had said.
\p
\v 14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart \add is\add* hardened, he
refuseth to let the people go. 
\v 15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water;
and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and the rod which
was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand. 
\v 16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me
unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness:
and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. 
\v 17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the
LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that \add is\add* in mine hand upon
the waters which \add are\add* in the river, and they shall be turned to
blood. 
\v 18 And the fish that \add is\add* in the river shall die, and the river
shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the
river.
\p
\v 19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch
out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their
rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may
become blood; and \add that\add* there may be blood throughout all the land of
Egypt, both in \add vessels of\add* wood, and in \add vessels of\add* stone. 
\v 20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the
rod, and smote the waters that \add were\add* in the river, in the sight of
Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that \add were
\add* in the river were turned to blood. 
\v 21 And the fish that \add was\add* in the river died; and the river stank,
and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was
blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s
heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said. 
\v 23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart
to this also. 
\v 24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink;
for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
\v 25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the
river.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus
saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 2 And if thou refuse to let \add them\add* go, behold, I will smite all thy
borders with frogs: 
\v 3 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and
come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the
house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into
thy kneadingtroughs: 
\v 4 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon
all thy servants.
\p
\v 5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand
with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause
frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt. 
\v 6 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs
came up, and covered the land of Egypt. 
\v 7 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs
upon the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 8 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that
he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the
people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD. 
\v 9 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for
thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee
and thy houses, \add that\add* they may remain in the river only? 
\v 10 And he said, To morrow. And he said, \add Be it\add* according to thy
word: that thou mayest know that \add there is\add* none like unto the LORD
our God. 
\v 11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy
servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. 
\v 12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD
because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. 
\v 13 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out
of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. 
\v 14 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank. 
\v 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and
hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.
\p
\v 16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and
smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of
Egypt. 
\v 17 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and
smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the
dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. 
\v 18 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice,
but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast. 
\v 19 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This \add is\add* the finger of
God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the
LORD had said.
\p
\v 20 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand
before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith
the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 21 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms 
\add of flies\add* upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and
into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms 
\add of flies,\add* and also the ground whereon they \add are. \add*
\v 22 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people
dwell, that no swarms \add of flies\add* shall be there; to the end thou
mayest know that I \add am\add* the LORD in the midst of the earth. 
\v 23 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow
shall this sign be. 
\v 24 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm \add of flies
\add* into the house of Pharaoh, and \add into\add* his servants’ houses, and
into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm 
\add of flies.\add*
\p
\v 25 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice
to your God in the land. 
\v 26 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the
abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the
abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? 
\v 27 We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the
LORD our God, as he shall command us. 
\v 28 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD
your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for
me. 
\v 29 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD
that the swarms \add of flies\add* may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants,
and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more
in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. 
\v 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 
\v 31 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the
swarms \add of flies\add* from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his
people; there remained not one. 
\v 32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let
the people go.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus
saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 2 For if thou refuse to let \add them\add* go, and wilt hold them still, 
\v 3 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which \add is\add* in the
field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and
upon the sheep: \add there shall be\add* a very grievous murrain. 
\v 4 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of
Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all \add that is\add* the children’s of
Israel. 
\v 5 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do
this thing in the land. 
\v 6 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt
died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. 
\v 7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the
Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the
people go.
\p
\v 8 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of
ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight
of Pharaoh. 
\v 9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a
boil breaking forth \add with\add* blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout
all the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses
sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth \add with
\add* blains upon man, and upon beast. 
\v 11 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for
the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. 
\v 12 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto
them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.
\p
\v 13 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand
before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let
my people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 14 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon
thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that \add there is
\add* none like me in all the earth. 
\v 15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people
with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. 
\v 16 And in very deed for this \add cause\add* have I raised thee up, for to
shew \add in\add* thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout
all the earth. 
\v 17 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let
them go? 
\v 18 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very
grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof
even until now. 
\v 19 Send therefore now, \add and\add* gather thy cattle, and all that thou
hast in the field; \add for upon\add* every man and beast which shall be found
in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon
them, and they shall die. 
\v 20 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made
his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: 
\v 21 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his
cattle in the field.
\p
\v 22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven,
that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and
upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. 
\v 23 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent
thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained
hail upon the land of Egypt. 
\v 24 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such
as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 
\v 25 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that \add was
\add* in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the
field, and brake every tree of the field. 
\v 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel \add were,
\add* was there no hail.
\p
\v 27 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I
have sinned this time: the LORD \add is\add* righteous, and I and my people 
\add are\add* wicked. 
\v 28 Intreat the LORD (for \add it is\add* enough) that there be no 
\add more\add* mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye
shall stay no longer. 
\v 29 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will
spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; \add and\add* the thunder shall cease,
neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth
\add is\add* the LORD’S. 
\v 30 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the
LORD God. 
\v 31 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear,
and the flax \add was\add* bolled. 
\v 32 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they \add were
\add* not grown up. 
\v 33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands
unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured
upon the earth. 
\v 34 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were
ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. 
\v 35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children
of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his
heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before
him: 
\v 2 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son,
what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among
them; that ye may know how that I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 3 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith
the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself
before me? let my people go, that they may serve me. 
\v 4 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring
the locusts into thy coast: 
\v 5 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to
see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which
remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for
you out of the field: 
\v 6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and
the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’
fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.
And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. 
\v 7 And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare
unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou
not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 
\v 8 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto
them, Go, serve the LORD your God: \add but\add* who \add are\add* they that
shall go? 
\v 9 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons
and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we
\add must hold\add* a feast unto the LORD. 
\v 10 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you
go, and your little ones: look \add to it;\add* for evil \add is\add* before
you. 
\v 11 Not so: go now ye \add that are\add* men, and serve the LORD; for that
ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.
\p
\v 12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of
Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat
every herb of the land, \add even\add* all that the hail hath left. 
\v 13 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD
brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all \add that\add* night;
\add and\add* when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. 
\v 14 And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all
the coasts of Egypt: very grievous \add were they;\add* before them there were
no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such. 
\v 15 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was
darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the
trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the
trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 16 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have
sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. 
\v 17 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat
the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only. 
\v 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD. 
\v 19 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the
locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all
the coasts of Egypt. 
\v 20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the
children of Israel go.
\p
\v 21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that
there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness \add which
\add* may be felt. 
\v 22 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick
darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: 
\v 23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three
days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
\p
\v 24 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let
your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. 
\v 25 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings,
that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God. 
\v 26 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left
behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not
with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.
\p
\v 27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go. 
\v 28 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see
my face no more; for in \add that\add* day thou seest my face thou shalt die.
\v 29 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no
more.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague \add more
\add* upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when
he shall let \add you\add* go, he shall surely thrust you out hence
altogether. 
\v 2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his
neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver, and jewels of
gold. 
\v 3 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians.
Moreover the man Moses \add was\add* very great in the land of Egypt, in the
sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people. 
\v 4 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into
the midst of Egypt: 
\v 5 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn
of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the
maidservant that \add is\add* behind the mill; and all the firstborn of
beasts. 
\v 6 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as
there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more. 
\v 7 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his
tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a
difference between the Egyptians and Israel. 
\v 8 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down
themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee:
and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. 
\v 9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my
wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD
hardened Pharaoh’s heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go
out of his land.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, 
\v 2 This month \add shall be\add* unto you the beginning of months: it 
\add shall be\add* the first month of the year to you.
\p
\v 3 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth 
\add day\add* of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb,
according to the house of \add their\add* fathers, a lamb for an house: 
\v 4 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his
neighbour next unto his house take \add it\add* according to the number of the
souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. 
\v 5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall
take \add it\add* out from the sheep, or from the goats: 
\v 6 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and
the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the
evening. 
\v 7 And they shall take of the blood, and strike \add it\add* on the two side
posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. 
\v 8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and
unleavened bread; \add and\add* with bitter \add herbs\add* they shall eat
it. 
\v 9 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast \add with
\add* fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. 
\v 10 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which
remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
\p
\v 11 And thus shall ye eat it; \add with\add* your loins girded, your shoes
on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it 
\add is\add* the LORD’S passover. 
\v 12 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all
the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the
gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye 
\add are:\add* and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague
shall not be upon you to destroy \add you,\add* when I smite the land of
Egypt. 
\v 14 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a
feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an
ordinance for ever. 
\v 15 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall
put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from
the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. 
\v 16 And in the first day \add there shall be\add* an holy convocation, and
in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of
work shall be done in them, save \add that\add* which every man must eat, that
only may be done of you. 
\v 17 And ye shall observe \add the feast of\add* unleavened bread; for in
this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:
therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for
ever.
\p
\v 18 In the first \add month,\add* on the fourteenth day of the month at
even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the
month at even. 
\v 19 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever
eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the
congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land. 
\v 20 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat
unleavened bread.
\p
\v 21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw
out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover. 
\v 22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip \add it\add* in the blood
that \add is\add* in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts
with the blood that \add is\add* in the bason; and none of you shall go out at
the door of his house until the morning. 
\v 23 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth
the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over
the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to
smite \add you. \add*
\v 24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons
for ever. 
\v 25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD
will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this
service. 
\v 26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What
mean ye by this service? 
\v 27 That ye shall say, It \add is\add* the sacrifice of the LORD’S passover,
who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote
the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and
worshipped. 
\v 28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded
Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\p
\v 29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn
in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne
unto the firstborn of the captive that \add was\add* in the dungeon; and all
the firstborn of cattle. 
\v 30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the
Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for \add there was\add* not a
house where \add there was\add* not one dead.
\p
\v 31 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, 
\add and\add* get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of
Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. 
\v 32 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and
bless me also. 
\v 33 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them
out of the land in haste; for they said, We \add be\add* all dead \add men. 
\add*
\v 34 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. 
\v 35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they
borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: 
\v 36 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so
that they lent unto them \add such things as they required.\add* And they
spoiled the Egyptians.
\p
\v 37 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six
hundred thousand on foot \add that were\add* men, beside children. 
\v 38 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, 
\add even\add* very much cattle. 
\v 39 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth
out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt,
and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.
\p
\v 40 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, 
\add was\add* four hundred and thirty years. 
\v 41 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years,
even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out
from the land of Egypt. 
\v 42 It \add is\add* a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing
them out from the land of Egypt: this \add is\add* that night of the LORD to
be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.
\p
\v 43 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This \add is\add* the ordinance
of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof: 
\v 44 But every man’s servant that is bought for money, when thou hast
circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof. 
\v 45 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof. 
\v 46 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the
flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof. 
\v 47 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. 
\v 48 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover
to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and
keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised
person shall eat thereof. 
\v 49 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that
sojourneth among you. 
\v 50 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and
Aaron, so did they. 
\v 51 And it came to pass the selfsame day, \add that\add* the LORD did bring
the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the
children of Israel, \add both\add* of man and of beast: it \add is\add* mine.
\p
\v 3 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out
from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD
brought you out from this \add place:\add* there shall no leavened bread be
eaten. 
\v 4 This day came ye out in the month Abib.
\p
\v 5 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the
Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with
milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month. 
\v 6 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day 
\add shall be\add* a feast to the LORD. 
\v 7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened
bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all
thy quarters.
\p
\v 8 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, \add This is done
\add* because of that \add which\add* the LORD did unto me when I came forth
out of Egypt. 
\v 9 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial
between thine eyes, that the LORD’S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong
hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. 
\v 10 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to
year.
\p
\v 11 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the
Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,
\v 12 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and
every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males \add shall
be\add* the LORD’S. 
\v 13 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou
wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of
man among thy children shalt thou redeem.
\p
\v 14 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What 
\add is\add* this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD
brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: 
\v 15 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD
slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and
the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the
matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem. 
\v 16 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between
thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led
them not \add through\add* the way of the land of the Philistines, although
that \add was\add* near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent
when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 
\v 18 But God led the people about, \add through\add* the way of the
wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of
the land of Egypt. 
\v 19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn
the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry
up my bones away hence with you.
\p
\v 20 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the
edge of the wilderness. 
\v 21 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead
them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by
day and night: 
\v 22 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire
by night, \add from\add* before the people.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before
Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it
shall ye encamp by the sea. 
\v 3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They \add are\add*
entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. 
\v 4 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, that he shall follow after them; and I
will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may
know that I \add am\add* the LORD. And they did so.
\p
\v 5 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of
Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why
have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? 
\v 6 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: 
\v 7 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt,
and captains over every one of them. 
\v 8 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued
after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high
hand. 
\v 9 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses \add and\add*
chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them
encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon.
\p
\v 10 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes,
and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and
the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD. 
\v 11 And they said unto Moses, Because \add there were\add* no graves in
Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou
dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt? 
\v 12 \add Is\add* not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying,
Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For \add it had been
\add* better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the
wilderness.
\p
\v 13 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the
salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians
whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. 
\v 14 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
\p
\v 15 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto
the children of Israel, that they go forward: 
\v 16 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and
divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry \add ground\add* through
the midst of the sea. 
\v 17 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall
follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host,
upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 
\v 18 And the Egyptians shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD, when I have
gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.
\p
\v 19 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and
went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and
stood behind them: 
\v 20 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel;
and it was a cloud and darkness \add to them,\add* but it gave light by night
\add to these:\add* so that the one came not near the other all the night. 
\v 21 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the
sea to go \add back\add* by a strong east wind all that night, and made the
sea dry \add land,\add* and the waters were divided. 
\v 22 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry 
\add ground:\add* and the waters \add were\add* a wall unto them on their
right hand, and on their left.
\p
\v 23 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the
sea, \add even\add* all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 
\v 24 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the
host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and
troubled the host of the Egyptians, 
\v 25 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that
the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth
for them against the Egyptians.
\p
\v 26 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that
the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon
their horsemen. 
\v 27 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to
his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and
the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. 
\v 28 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, 
\add and\add* all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there
remained not so much as one of them. 
\v 29 But the children of Israel walked upon dry \add land\add* in the midst
of the sea; and the waters \add were\add* a wall unto them on their right
hand, and on their left. 
\v 30 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;
and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. 
\v 31 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians:
and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and
spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously:
the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
\v 2 The LORD \add is\add* my strength and song, and he is become my
salvation: he \add is\add* my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my
father’s God, and I will exalt him. 
\v 3 The LORD \add is\add* a man of war: the LORD \add is\add* his name. 
\v 4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen
captains also are drowned in the Red sea. 
\v 5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone. 
\v 6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O
LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. 
\v 7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that
rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, \add which\add* consumed
them as stubble. 
\v 8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the
floods stood upright as an heap, \add and\add* the depths were congealed in
the heart of the sea. 
\v 9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall
destroy them. 
\v 10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead
in the mighty waters. 
\v 11 Who \add is\add* like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who \add is
\add* like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful \add in\add* praises, doing
wonders? 
\v 12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. 
\v 13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people \add which\add* thou hast
redeemed: thou hast guided \add them\add* in thy strength unto thy holy
habitation. 
\v 14 The people shall hear, \add and\add* be afraid: sorrow shall take hold
on the inhabitants of Palestina. 
\v 15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt
away. 
\v 16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they
shall be \add as\add* still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD,
till the people pass over, \add which\add* thou hast purchased. 
\v 17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine
inheritance, \add in\add* the place, O LORD, \add which\add* thou hast made
for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O Lord, \add which\add* thy hands have
established. 
\v 18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. 
\v 19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen
into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but
the children of Israel went on dry \add land\add* in the midst of the sea.
\p
\v 20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her
hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances. 
\v 21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed
gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. 
\v 22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the
wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no
water.
\p
\v 23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of
Marah, for they \add were\add* bitter: therefore the name of it was called
Marah. 
\v 24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? 
\v 25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, \add which
\add* when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he
made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, 
\v 26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy
God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his
commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases
upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I \add am\add* the
LORD that healeth thee.
\p
\v 27 And they came to Elim, where \add were\add* twelve wells of water, and
threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the
children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which \add is\add* between
Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing
out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 2 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against
Moses and Aaron in the wilderness: 
\v 3 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by
the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, 
\add and\add* when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth
into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.
\p
\v 4 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for
you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I
may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. 
\v 5 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare 
\add that\add* which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they
gather daily. 
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then
ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: 
\v 7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he
heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what \add are\add* we, that ye
murmur against us? 
\v 8 And Moses said, \add This shall be,\add* when the LORD shall give you in
the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the
LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what \add are
\add* we? your murmurings \add are\add* not against us, but against the LORD.
\p
\v 9 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children
of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. 
\v 10 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the
children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the
glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.
\p
\v 11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 12 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them,
saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with
bread; and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD your God. 
\v 13 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the
camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 
\v 14 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the
wilderness \add there lay\add* a small round thing, \add as\add* small as the
hoar frost on the ground. 
\v 15 And when the children of Israel saw \add it,\add* they said one to
another, It \add is\add* manna: for they wist not what it \add was.
\add* And Moses said unto them, This \add is\add* the bread which the LORD
hath given you to eat.
\p
\v 16 This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
every man \add according to\add* his eating, an omer for every man, according
to the number of your persons; take ye every man for \add them\add* which 
\add are\add* in his tents. 
\v 17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. 
\v 18 And when they did mete \add it\add* with an omer, he that gathered much
had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every
man according to his eating. 
\v 19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 
\v 20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of
it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with
them. 
\v 21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating:
and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
\p
\v 22 And it came to pass, \add that\add* on the sixth day they gathered twice
as much bread, two omers for one \add man:\add* and all the rulers of the
congregation came and told Moses. 
\v 23 And he said unto them, This \add is that\add* which the LORD hath said,
To morrow \add is\add* the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake 
\add that\add* which ye will bake \add to day,\add* and seethe that ye will
seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the
morning. 
\v 24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not
stink, neither was there any worm therein. 
\v 25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day \add is\add* a sabbath unto
the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. 
\v 26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, \add which is
\add* the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
\p
\v 27 And it came to pass, \add that\add* there went out \add some\add* of the
people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. 
\v 28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments
and my laws? 
\v 29 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth
you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place,
let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 
\v 30 So the people rested on the seventh day. 
\v 31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it 
\add was\add* like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it \add was
\add* like wafers \add made\add* with honey.
\p
\v 32 And Moses said, This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD commandeth,
Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the
bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth
from the land of Egypt. 
\v 33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna
therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 
\v 34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony,
to be kept. 
\v 35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to
a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the
land of Canaan. 
\v 36 Now an omer \add is\add* the tenth \add part\add* of an ephah.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the
wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the
LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and \add there was\add* no water for the people
to drink. 
\v 2 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that
we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye
tempt the LORD? 
\v 3 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against
Moses, and said, Wherefore \add is\add* this \add that\add* thou hast brought
us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? 
\v 4 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people?
they be almost ready to stone me. 
\v 5 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee
of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take
in thine hand, and go. 
\v 6 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou
shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people
may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 
\v 7 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the
chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying,
Is the LORD among us, or not?
\p
\v 8 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. 
\v 9 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with
Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in
mine hand. 
\v 10 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and
Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
\v 11 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed:
and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. 
\v 12 But Moses’ hands \add were\add* heavy; and they took a stone, and put 
\add it\add* under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his
hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands
were steady until the going down of the sun. 
\v 13 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the
sword. 
\v 14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this \add for\add* a memorial in a
book, and rehearse \add it\add* in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put
out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. 
\v 15 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovah-nissi: 
\v 16 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn \add that\add* the LORD 
\add will have\add* war with Amalek from generation to generation.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of all
that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, \add and\add* that the
LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt; 
\v 2 Then Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he
had sent her back, 
\v 3 And her two sons; of which the name of the one \add was\add* Gershom; for
he said, I have been an alien in a strange land: 
\v 4 And the name of the other \add was\add* Eliezer; for the God of my
father, \add said he, was\add* mine help, and delivered me from the sword of
Pharaoh: 
\v 5 And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto
Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: 
\v 6 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and
thy wife, and her two sons with her.
\p
\v 7 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and
kissed him; and they asked each other of \add their\add* welfare; and they
came into the tent. 
\v 8 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh
and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, \add and\add* all the travail that had
come upon them by the way, and \add how\add* the LORD delivered them. 
\v 9 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to
Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. 
\v 10 And Jethro said, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD, who hath delivered you
out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath
delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 
\v 11 Now I know that the LORD \add is\add* greater than all gods: for in the
thing wherein they dealt proudly \add he was\add* above them. 
\v 12 And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices
for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with
Moses’ father in law before God.
\p
\v 13 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people:
and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 
\v 14 And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he
said, What \add is\add* this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest
thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? 
\v 15 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me
to enquire of God: 
\v 16 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and
another, and I do make \add them\add* know the statutes of God, and his laws.
\v 17 And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest 
\add is\add* not good. 
\v 18 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that \add is
\add* with thee: for this thing \add is\add* too heavy for thee; thou art not
able to perform it thyself alone. 
\v 19 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be
with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the
causes unto God: 
\v 20 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the
way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do. 
\v 21 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear
God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place \add such\add* over them, 
\add to be\add* rulers of thousands, \add and\add* rulers of hundreds, rulers
of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
\v 22 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, 
\add that\add* every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small
matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall
bear \add the burden\add* with thee. 
\v 23 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee \add so,\add* then
thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place
in peace. 
\v 24 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that
he had said. 
\v 25 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the
people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers
of tens. 
\v 26 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought
unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
\p
\v 27 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own
land.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of
the land of Egypt, the same day came they \add into\add* the wilderness of
Sinai. 
\v 2 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come \add to\add* the
desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped
before the mount. 
\v 3 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the
mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the
children of Israel; 
\v 4 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and \add how\add* I bare you
on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself. 
\v 5 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant,
then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the
earth \add is\add* mine: 
\v 6 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These 
\add are\add* the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
\p
\v 7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before
their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. 
\v 8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath
spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. 
\v 9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that
the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And
Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.
\p
\v 10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to
day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, 
\v 11 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come
down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. 
\v 12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed
to yourselves, \add that ye\add* go \add not\add* up into the mount, or touch
the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: 
\v 13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot
through; whether \add it be\add* beast or man, it shall not live: when the
trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
\p
\v 14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the
people; and they washed their clothes. 
\v 15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at
\add your\add* wives.
\p
\v 16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were
thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of
the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that \add was\add* in the
camp trembled. 
\v 17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and
they stood at the nether part of the mount. 
\v 18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended
upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and
the whole mount quaked greatly. 
\v 19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and
louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. 
\v 20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and
the LORD called Moses \add up\add* to the top of the mount; and Moses went
up. 
\v 21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they
break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. 
\v 22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify
themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. 
\v 23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai:
for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. 
\v 24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up,
thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break
through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. 
\v 25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 And God spake all these words, saying, 
\v 2 I \add am\add* the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land
of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
\v 3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 
\v 4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness 
\add of any thing\add* that \add is\add* in heaven above, or that \add is
\add* in the earth beneath, or that \add is\add* in the water under the
earth: 
\v 5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD
thy God \add am\add* a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon
the children unto the third and fourth \add generation\add* of them that hate
me; 
\v 6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
commandments. 
\v 7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD
will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 
\v 8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 
\v 9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: 
\v 10 But the seventh day \add is\add* the sabbath of the LORD thy God: 
\add in it\add* thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy
stranger that \add is\add* within thy gates: 
\v 11 For \add in\add* six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
all that in them \add is,\add* and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD
blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.
\p
\v 12 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the
land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. 
\v 13 Thou shalt not kill. 
\v 14 Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
\v 15 Thou shalt not steal. 
\v 16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
\v 17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy
neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his
ass, nor any thing that \add is\add* thy neighbour’s.
\p
\v 18 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the
noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw 
\add it,\add* they removed, and stood afar off. 
\v 19 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let
not God speak with us, lest we die. 
\v 20 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you,
and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not. 
\v 21 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick
darkness where God \add was.\add*
\p
\v 22 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of
Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven. 
\v 23 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you
gods of gold.
\p
\v 24 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon
thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in
all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless
thee. 
\v 25 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of
hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it. 
\v 26 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be
not discovered thereon.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the judgments which thou shalt set before them. 
\v 2 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the
seventh he shall go out free for nothing. 
\v 3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married,
then his wife shall go out with him. 
\v 4 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or
daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go
out by himself. 
\v 5 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my
children; I will not go out free: 
\v 6 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him
to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through
with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever.
\p
\v 7 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out
as the menservants do. 
\v 8 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then
shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have
no power, seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her. 
\v 9 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after
the manner of daughters. 
\v 10 If he take him another \add wife;\add* her food, her raiment, and her
duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. 
\v 11 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out free
without money.
\p
\v 12 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to death. 
\v 13 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver \add him\add* into his
hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee. 
\v 14 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay him with
guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he may die.
\p
\v 15 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to
death.
\p
\v 16 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found in his
hand, he shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 17 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be put to
death.
\p
\v 18 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a stone, or with
\add his\add* fist, and he die not, but keepeth \add his\add* bed: 
\v 19 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall he that
smote \add him\add* be quit: only he shall pay \add for\add* the loss of his
time, and shall cause \add him\add* to be thoroughly healed.
\p
\v 20 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he die
under his hand; he shall be surely punished. 
\v 21 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished:
for he \add is\add* his money.
\p
\v 22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart 
\add from her,\add* and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished,
according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the
judges \add determine. \add*
\v 23 And if \add any\add* mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for
life, 
\v 24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
\v 25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
\p
\v 26 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that
it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake. 
\v 27 And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth, or his maidservant’s tooth;
he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.
\p
\v 28 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be
surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox 
\add shall be\add* quit. 
\v 29 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past, and it hath
been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath
killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be
put to death. 
\v 30 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the
ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him. 
\v 31 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter, according to this
judgment shall it be done unto him. 
\v 32 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give unto
their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
\p
\v 33 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit, and not
cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein; 
\v 34 The owner of the pit shall make \add it\add* good, \add and\add* give
money unto the owner of them; and the dead \add beast\add* shall be his.
\p
\v 35 And if one man’s ox hurt another’s, that he die; then they shall sell
the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the dead \add ox\add* also they
shall divide. 
\v 36 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past, and his
owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for ox; and the dead shall
be his own.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall
restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.
\p
\v 2 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, \add there
shall\add* no blood \add be shed\add* for him. 
\v 3 If the sun be risen upon him, \add there shall be\add* blood \add shed
\add* for him; \add for\add* he should make full restitution; if he have
nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft. 
\v 4 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or
ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.
\p
\v 5 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in
his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own
field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.
\p
\v 6 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or
the standing corn, or the field, be consumed \add therewith;\add* he that
kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
\p
\v 7 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it
be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, let him pay double. 
\v 8 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought
unto the judges, \add to see\add* whether he have put his hand unto his
neighbour’s goods. 
\v 9 For all manner of trespass, \add whether it be\add* for ox, for ass, for
sheep, for raiment, \add or\add* for any manner of lost thing, which 
\add another\add* challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come
before the judges; \add and\add* whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay
double unto his neighbour. 
\v 10 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any
beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing 
\add it: \add*
\v 11 \add Then\add* shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he
hath not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods; and the owner of it shall
accept \add thereof,\add* and he shall not make \add it\add* good. 
\v 12 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner
thereof. 
\v 13 If it be torn in pieces, \add then\add* let him bring it \add for
\add* witness, \add and\add* he shall not make good that which was torn.
\p
\v 14 And if a man borrow \add ought\add* of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or
die, the owner thereof \add being\add* not with it, he shall surely make 
\add it\add* good. 
\v 15 \add But\add* if the owner thereof \add be\add* with it, he shall not
make \add it\add* good: if it \add be\add* an hired \add thing,\add* it came
for his hire.
\p
\v 16 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he
shall surely endow her to be his wife. 
\v 17 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money
according to the dowry of virgins.
\p
\v 18 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
\p
\v 19 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 20 He that sacrificeth unto \add any\add* god, save unto the LORD only, he
shall be utterly destroyed.
\p
\v 21 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were
strangers in the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 22 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child. 
\v 23 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will
surely hear their cry; 
\v 24 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your
wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
\p
\v 25 If thou lend money to \add any of\add* my people \add that is
\add* poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou
lay upon him usury. 
\v 26 If thou at all take thy neighbour’s raiment to pledge, thou shalt
deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down: 
\v 27 For that \add is\add* his covering only, it \add is\add* his raiment for
his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth
unto me, that I will hear; for I \add am\add* gracious.
\p
\v 28 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.
\p
\v 29 Thou shalt not delay \add to offer\add* the first of thy ripe fruits,
and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me. 
\v 30 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, \add and\add* with thy sheep:
seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.
\p
\v 31 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat \add any
\add* flesh \add that is\add* torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to
the dogs.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with the wicked
to be an unrighteous witness.
\p
\v 2 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to \add do\add* evil; neither shalt
thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest \add judgment:
\add*
\p
\v 3 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.
\p
\v 4 If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely
bring it back to him again. 
\v 5 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and
wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him. 
\v 6 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause. 
\v 7 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay
thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
\p
\v 8 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise, and
perverteth the words of the righteous.
\p
\v 9 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a
stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
\v 10 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the fruits
thereof: 
\v 11 But the seventh \add year\add* thou shalt let it rest and lie still;
that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the
field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, \add and
\add* with thy oliveyard. 
\v 12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest:
that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the
stranger, may be refreshed. 
\v 13 And in all \add things\add* that I have said unto you be circumspect:
and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of
thy mouth.
\p
\v 14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. 
\v 15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the
month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before
me empty:) 
\v 16 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou
hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, \add which is
\add* in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of
the field. 
\v 17 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
\v 18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread;
neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. 
\v 19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house
of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.
\p
\v 20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to
bring thee into the place which I have prepared. 
\v 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not
pardon your transgressions: for my name \add is\add* in him. 
\v 22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I
will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
\v 23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the
Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the
Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off. 
\v 24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after
their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their
images. 
\v 25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and
thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
\p
\v 26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the
number of thy days I will fulfil. 
\v 27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom
thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto
thee. 
\v 28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite,
the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. 
\v 29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land
become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. 
\v 30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou
be increased, and inherit the land. 
\v 31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the
Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the
inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before
thee. 
\v 32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. 
\v 33 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:
for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and Aaron, Nadab,
and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off. 
\v 2 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come nigh;
neither shall the people go up with him.
\p
\v 3 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the
judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words
which the LORD hath said will we do. 
\v 4 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the
morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to
the twelve tribes of Israel. 
\v 5 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt
offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the LORD. 
\v 6 And Moses took half of the blood, and put \add it\add* in basons; and
half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 
\v 7 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the
people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will we do, and be
obedient. 
\v 8 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled \add it\add* on the people, and
said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath made with you
concerning all these words.
\p
\v 9 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the
elders of Israel: 
\v 10 And they saw the God of Israel: and \add there was\add* under his feet
as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven
in \add his\add* clearness. 
\v 11 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also
they saw God, and did eat and drink.
\p
\v 12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be
there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which
I have written; that thou mayest teach them. 
\v 13 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the
mount of God. 
\v 14 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again
unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur \add are\add* with you: if any man have
any matters to do, let him come unto them. 
\v 15 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount. 
\v 16 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered
it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Moses out of the midst of the
cloud. 
\v 17 And the sight of the glory of the LORD \add was\add* like devouring fire
on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel. 
\v 18 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up into the
mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of
every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. 
\v 3 And this \add is\add* the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and
silver, and brass, 
\v 4 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats \add hair, 
\add*
\v 5 And rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood, 
\v 6 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense, 
\v 7 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate. 
\v 8 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. 
\v 9 According to all that I shew thee, \add after\add* the pattern of the
tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye
make \add it.\add*
\p
\v 10 And they shall make an ark \add of\add* shittim wood: two cubits and a
half \add shall be\add* the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth
thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof. 
\v 11 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou
overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. 
\v 12 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put \add them
\add* in the four corners thereof; and two rings \add shall be\add* in the one
side of it, and two rings in the other side of it. 
\v 13 And thou shalt make staves \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlay them
with gold. 
\v 14 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
that the ark may be borne with them. 
\v 15 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken
from it. 
\v 16 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee. 
\v 17 And thou shalt make a mercy seat \add of\add* pure gold: two cubits and
a half \add shall be\add* the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
breadth thereof. 
\v 18 And thou shalt make two cherubims \add of\add* gold, \add of\add* beaten
work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat. 
\v 19 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other
end: \add even\add* of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two
ends thereof. 
\v 20 And the cherubim shall stretch forth \add their\add* wings on high,
covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces \add shall look
\add* one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims
be. 
\v 21 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark
thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee. 
\v 22 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above
the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which \add are\add* upon the
ark of the testimony, of all \add things\add* which I will give thee in
commandment unto the children of Israel.
\p
\v 23 Thou shalt also make a table \add of\add* shittim wood: two cubits

\c 29
\p
\v 1 And this \add is\add* the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
them, to minister unto me in the priest’s office: Take one young bullock, and

\v 2 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers
unleavened anointed with oil: \add of\add* wheaten flour shalt thou make
them. 
\v 3 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket,

\v 4 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the tabernacle

\v 5 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat, and the
robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate, and gird him with the

\v 10 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the tabernacle of
the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head
of the bullock. 
\v 11 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, \add by\add* the door

\v 12 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put \add it
\add* upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the blood
beside the bottom of the altar. 
\v 13 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul
\add that is\add* above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is
upon them, and burn \add them\add* upon the altar. 
\v 14 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung, shalt thou
burn with fire without the camp: it \add is\add* a sin offering.
\p
\v 15 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put their
hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 16 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood, and sprinkle
\add it\add* round about upon the altar. 
\v 17 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him, and
his legs, and put \add them\add* unto his pieces, and unto his head. 
\v 18 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it \add is\add* a
burnt offering unto the LORD: it \add is\add* a sweet savour, an offering made
by fire unto the LORD.
\p
\v 19 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
their hands upon the head of the ram. 
\v 20 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put \add it
\add* upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of the right
ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great
toe of their right foot, and sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 
\v 21 And thou shalt take of the blood that \add is\add* upon the altar, and
of the anointing oil, and sprinkle \add it\add* upon Aaron, and upon his
garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: and
he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments
with him. 
\v 22 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the fat that
covereth the inwards, and the \add caul\add* above the liver, and the two
kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* upon them, and the right shoulder; for
it \add is\add* a ram of consecration: 
\v 23 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer out of
the basket of the unleavened bread that \add is\add* before the LORD: 
\v 24 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his
sons; and shalt wave them \add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD. 
\v 25 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn \add them
\add* upon the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the LORD:
it \add is\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD. 
\v 26 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s consecration, and
wave it \add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD: and it shall be thy
part. 
\v 27 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the
shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up, of the
ram of the consecration, \add even\add* of \add that\add* which \add is
\add* for Aaron, and of \add that\add* which is for his sons: 
\v 28 And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’ by a statute for ever from the
children of Israel: for it \add is\add* an heave offering: and it shall be an
heave offering from the children of Israel of the sacrifice of their peace
offerings, \add even\add* their heave offering unto the LORD.
\p
\v 29 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons’ after him, to be
anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them. 
\v 30 \add And\add* that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on
seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the congregation to minister
in the holy \add place.\add*
\p
\v 31 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in
the holy place. 
\v 32 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread
that \add is\add* in the basket, \add by\add* the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation. 
\v 33 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was made, to
consecrate \add and\add* to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat 
\add thereof,\add* because they \add are\add* holy. 
\v 34 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the bread, remain
unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the remainder with fire: it shall not
be eaten, because it \add is\add* holy. 
\v 35 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according to all 
\add things\add* which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate
them. 
\v 36 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock \add for\add* a sin offering
for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou hast made an
atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to sanctify it. 
\v 37 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and sanctify it;
and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be
holy.
\p
\v 38 Now this \add is that\add* which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two
lambs of the first year day by day continually. 
\v 39 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other lamb thou
shalt offer at even: 
\v 40 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part
of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine \add for
\add* a drink offering. 
\v 41 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do thereto
according to the meat offering of the morning, and according to the drink
offering thereof, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\v 42 \add This shall be\add* a continual burnt offering throughout your
generations \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before
the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto thee. 
\v 43 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and \add the
tabernacle\add* shall be sanctified by my glory. 
\v 44 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar: I
will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to minister to me in the priest’s
office.
\p
\v 45 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 
\v 46 And they shall know that I \add am\add* the LORD their God, that brought
them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them: I 
\add am\add* the LORD their God.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: \add of\add* shittim
wood shalt thou make it. 
\v 2 A cubit \add shall be\add* the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits \add shall be\add* the height
thereof: the horns thereof \add shall be\add* of the same. 
\v 3 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides
thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a
crown of gold round about. 
\v 4 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of it, by the
two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make \add it;
\add* and they shall be for places for the staves to bear it withal. 
\v 5 And thou shalt make the staves \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlay
them with gold. 
\v 6 And thou shalt put it before the vail that \add is\add* by the ark of the
testimony, before the mercy seat that \add is\add* over the testimony, where I
will meet with thee. 
\v 7 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he
dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. 
\v 8 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn incense upon it,
a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 
\v 9 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor meat
offering; neither shall ye pour drink offering thereon. 
\v 10 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year
with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once in the year shall he
make atonement upon it throughout your generations: it \add is\add* most holy
unto the LORD.
\p
\v 11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 12 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number,
then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the LORD, when thou
numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when \add thou\add*
numberest them. 
\v 13 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that are
numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary: (a shekel 
\add is\add* twenty gerahs:) an half shekel \add shall be\add* the offering of
the LORD. 
\v 14 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from twenty years
old and above, shall give an offering unto the LORD. 
\v 15 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half
a shekel, when \add they\add* give an offering unto the LORD, to make an
atonement for your souls. 
\v 16 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of Israel, and
shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; that
it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the LORD, to make an
atonement for your souls.
\p
\v 17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 18 Thou shalt also make a laver \add of\add* brass, and his foot 
\add also of\add* brass, to wash \add withal:\add* and thou shalt put it
between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt put
water therein. 
\v 19 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat: 
\v 20 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they shall wash
with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to
minister, to burn offering made by fire unto the LORD: 
\v 21 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it
shall be a statute for ever to them, \add even\add* to him and to his seed
throughout their generations.
\p
\v 22 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 23 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five hundred 
\add shekels,\add* and of sweet cinnamon half so much, \add even\add* two
hundred and fifty \add shekels,\add* and of sweet calamus two hundred and
fifty \add shekels, \add*
\v 24 And of cassia five hundred \add shekels,\add* after the shekel of the
sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin: 
\v 25 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound
after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil. 
\v 26 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith, and
the ark of the testimony, 
\v 27 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his vessels,
and the altar of incense, 
\v 28 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the laver and
his foot. 
\v 29 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever
toucheth them shall be holy. 
\v 30 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that 
\add they\add* may minister unto me in the priest’s office. 
\v 31 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be
an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations. 
\v 32 Upon man’s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make 
\add any other\add* like it, after the composition of it: it \add is
\add* holy, \add and\add* it shall be holy unto you. 
\v 33 Whosoever compoundeth \add any\add* like it, or whosoever putteth 
\add any\add* of it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and
onycha, and galbanum; \add these\add* sweet spices with pure frankincense: of
each shall there be a like \add weight: \add*
\v 35 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art of the
apothecary, tempered together, pure \add and\add* holy: 
\v 36 And thou shalt beat \add some\add* of it very small, and put of it
before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will meet
with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. 
\v 37 And \add as for\add* the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not
make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it shall be unto thee
holy for the LORD. 
\v 38 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall even be cut
off from his people.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of
the tribe of Judah: 
\v 3 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in
understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship, 
\v 4 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
\v 5 And in cutting of stones, to set \add them,\add* and in carving of
timber, to work in all manner of workmanship. 
\v 6 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of
the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put
wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee; 
\v 7 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the
mercy seat that \add is\add* thereupon, and all the furniture of the
tabernacle, 
\v 8 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his
furniture, and the altar of incense, 
\v 9 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and
his foot, 
\v 10 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest,
and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office, 
\v 11 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy \add place:
\add* according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.
\p
\v 12 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 13 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths
ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your
generations; that ye may know that I \add am\add* the LORD that doth sanctify
you. 
\v 14 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it \add is\add* holy unto you:
every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth 
\add any\add* work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
\v 15 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest,
holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth \add any\add* work in the sabbath day, he
shall surely be put to death. 
\v 16 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the
sabbath throughout their generations, \add for\add* a perpetual covenant. 
\v 17 It \add is\add* a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
for \add in\add* six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh
day he rested, and was refreshed.
\p
\v 18 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him
upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the
finger of God.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount,
the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron, and said unto him, Up,
make us gods, which shall go before us; for \add as for\add* this Moses, the
man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of
him. 
\v 2 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which 
\add are\add* in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,
and bring \add them\add* unto me. 
\v 3 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which \add were
\add* in their ears, and brought \add them\add* unto Aaron. 
\v 4 And he received \add them\add* at their hand, and fashioned it with a
graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These 
\add be\add* thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of
Egypt. 
\v 5 And when Aaron saw \add it,\add* he built an altar before it; and Aaron
made proclamation, and said, To morrow \add is\add* a feast to the LORD. 
\v 6 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and
brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose
up to play.
\p
\v 7 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which
thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted \add themselves: 
\add*
\v 8 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them:
they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed
thereunto, and said, These \add be\add* thy gods, O Israel, which have brought
thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
\v 9 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it 
\add is\add* a stiffnecked people: 
\v 10 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and
that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 
\v 11 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath
wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of
Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? 
\v 12 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring
them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of
the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy
people. 
\v 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom thou swarest
by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the
stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your
seed, and they shall inherit \add it\add* for ever. 
\v 14 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his
people.
\p
\v 15 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of
the testimony \add were\add* in his hand: the tables \add were\add* written on
both their sides; on the one side and on the other \add were\add* they
written. 
\v 16 And the tables \add were\add* the work of God, and the writing 
\add was\add* the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
\v 17 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said
unto Moses, \add There is\add* a noise of war in the camp. 
\v 18 And he said, \add It is\add* not the voice of \add them that\add* shout
for mastery, neither \add is it\add* the voice of \add them that\add* cry for
being overcome: \add but\add* the noise of \add them that\add* sing do I
hear.
\p
\v 19 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw
the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables
out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 
\v 20 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt \add it\add* in the
fire, and ground \add it\add* to powder, and strawed \add it\add* upon the
water, and made the children of Israel drink \add of it. \add*
\v 21 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou
hast brought so great a sin upon them? 
\v 22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the
people, that they are \add set\add* on mischief. 
\v 23 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for 
\add as for\add* this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of
Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. 
\v 24 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break 
\add it\add* off. So they gave \add it\add* me: then I cast it into the fire,
and there came out this calf.
\p
\v 25 And when Moses saw that the people \add were\add* naked; (for Aaron had
made them naked unto \add their\add* shame among their enemies:) 
\v 26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who \add is
\add* on the LORD’S side? \add let him come\add* unto me. And all the sons of
Levi gathered themselves together unto him. 
\v 27 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man
his sword by his side, \add and\add* go in and out from gate to gate
throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his
companion, and every man his neighbour. 
\v 28 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there
fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
\v 29 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to day to the LORD, even every
man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing
this day.
\p
\v 30 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the people, Ye
have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I
shall make an atonement for your sin. 
\v 31 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned
a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 
\v 32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray
thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 
\v 33 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will
I blot out of my book. 
\v 34 Therefore now go, lead the people unto \add the place\add* of which I
have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless
in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. 
\v 35 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron
made.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, \add and\add* go up hence, thou and
the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt, unto the land
which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will
I give it: 
\v 2 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite,
the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
Jebusite: 
\v 3 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the
midst of thee; for thou \add art\add* a stiffnecked people: lest I consume
thee in the way.
\p
\v 4 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man
did put on him his ornaments. 
\v 5 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of Israel, Ye 
\add are\add* a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a
moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that
I may know what to do unto thee. 
\v 6 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the
mount Horeb. 
\v 7 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off
from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came
to pass, \add that\add* every one which sought the LORD went out unto the
tabernacle of the congregation, which \add was\add* without the camp. 
\v 8 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle, \add that
\add* all the people rose up, and stood every man \add at\add* his tent door,
and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle. 
\v 9 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy
pillar descended, and stood \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle, and 
\add the\add* LORD talked with Moses. 
\v 10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand \add at\add* the
tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man 
\add in\add* his tent door. 
\v 11 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his
friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of
Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.
\p
\v 12 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring up this
people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou
hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. 
\v 13 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, shew me
now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and
consider that this nation \add is\add* thy people. 
\v 14 And he said, My presence shall go \add with thee,\add* and I will give
thee rest. 
\v 15 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not \add with me,\add* carry us
not up hence. 
\v 16 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found
grace in thy sight? \add is it\add* not in that thou goest with us? so shall
we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that \add are
\add* upon the face of the earth. 
\v 17 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast
spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. 
\v 18 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory. 
\v 19 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will
proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will
be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will shew mercy. 
\v 20 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me,
and live. 
\v 21 And the LORD said, Behold, \add there is\add* a place by me, and thou
shalt stand upon a rock: 
\v 22 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put
thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand while I pass
by: 
\v 23 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my
face shall not be seen.
\c 34
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the
first: and I will write upon \add these\add* tables the words that were in the
first tables, which thou brakest. 
\v 2 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai,
and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount. 
\v 3 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen
throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that
mount.
\p
\v 4 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up
early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded
him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. 
\v 5 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and
proclaimed the name of the LORD. 
\v 6 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD
God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and
truth, 
\v 7 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and
sin, and that will by no means clear \add the guilty;\add* visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children,
unto the third and to the fourth \add generation. \add*
\v 8 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
worshipped. 
\v 9 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord,
I pray thee, go among us; for it \add is\add* a stiffnecked people; and pardon
our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
\p
\v 10 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do
marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and
all the people among which thou \add art\add* shall see the work of the LORD:
for it \add is\add* a terrible thing that I will do with thee. 
\v 11 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out
before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the
Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 
\v 12 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of
the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: 
\v 13 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down
their groves: 
\v 14 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name 
\add is\add* Jealous, \add is\add* a jealous God: 
\v 15 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go
a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto their gods, and \add one
\add* call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; 
\v 16 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters go a
whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods. 
\v 17 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
\p
\v 18 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat
unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in
the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. 
\v 19 All that openeth the matrix \add is\add* mine; and every firstling among
thy cattle, \add whether\add* ox or sheep, \add that is male. \add*
\v 20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou
redeem \add him\add* not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of
thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty.
\p
\v 21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in
earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
\p
\v 22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat
harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.
\p
\v 23 Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord
GOD, the God of Israel. 
\v 24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders:
neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before
the LORD thy God thrice in the year. 
\v 25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither
shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. 
\v 26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house
of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk. 
\v 27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the
tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. 
\v 28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did
neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of
the covenant, the ten commandments.
\p
\v 29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two
tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that
Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. 
\v 30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the
skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. 
\v 31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the
congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 
\v 32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in
commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. 
\v 33 And \add till\add* Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on
his face. 
\v 34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the
vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of
Israel \add that\add* which he was commanded. 
\v 35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of
Moses’ face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went
in to speak with him.
\c 35
\p
\v 1 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel
together, and said unto them, These \add are\add* the words which the LORD
hath commanded, that \add ye\add* should do them. 
\v 2 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you
an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall
be put to death. 
\v 3 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath
day.
\p
\v 4 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel,
saying, This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, 
\v 5 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever \add is
\add* of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and
silver, and brass, 
\v 6 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ \add hair,
\add*
\v 7 And rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins, and shittim wood, 
\v 8 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for the sweet
incense, 
\v 9 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the
breastplate. 
\v 10 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that the LORD
hath commanded; 
\v 11 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and his boards,
his bars, his pillars, and his sockets, 
\v 12 The ark, and the staves thereof, \add with\add* the mercy seat, and the
vail of the covering, 
\v 13 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the shewbread, 
\v 14 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his lamps,
with the oil for the light, 
\v 15 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil, and the
sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the entering in of the
tabernacle, 
\v 16 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his staves, and all
his vessels, the laver and his foot, 
\v 17 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and the
hanging for the door of the court, 
\v 18 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords,
\v 19 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy \add place,\add* the
holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister
in the priest’s office.
\p
\v 20 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the
presence of Moses. 
\v 21 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom
his spirit made willing, \add and\add* they brought the LORD’S offering to the
work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for
the holy garments. 
\v 22 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, 
\add and\add* brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and tablets, all
jewels of gold: and every man that offered \add offered\add* an offering of
gold unto the LORD. 
\v 23 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and
fine linen, and goats’ \add hair,\add* and red skins of rams, and badgers’
skins, brought \add them. \add*
\v 24 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought the
LORD’S offering: and every man, with whom was found shittim wood for any work
of the service, brought \add it. \add*
\v 25 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their hands, and
brought that which they had spun, \add both\add* of blue, and of purple, 
\add and\add* of scarlet, and of fine linen. 
\v 26 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun goats’ 
\add hair. \add*
\v 27 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod,
and for the breastplate; 
\v 28 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the
sweet incense. 
\v 29 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the LORD, every
man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work,
which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses.
\p
\v 30 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by
name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 
\v 31 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 
\v 32 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in
brass, 
\v 33 And in the cutting of stones, to set \add them,\add* and in carving of
wood, to make any manner of cunning work. 
\v 34 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, \add both\add* he, and
Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 
\v 35 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of
the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and
in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, \add even
\add* of them that do any work, and of those that devise cunning work.
\c 36
\p
\v 1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in whom
the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work
for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had
commanded. 
\v 2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man, in
whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, \add even\add* every one whose heart
stirred him up to come unto the work to do it: 
\v 3 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children of Israel
had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it 
\add withal.\add* And they brought yet unto him free offerings every morning.
\v 4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came
every man from his work which they made;
\p
\v 5 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough
for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make. 
\v 6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for
the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. 
\v 7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and
too much.
\p
\v 8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of the
tabernacle made ten curtains \add of\add* fine twined linen, and blue, and
purple, and scarlet: \add with\add* cherubims of cunning work made he them. 
\v 9 The length of one curtain \add was\add* twenty and eight cubits, and the
breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains \add were\add* all of one
size. 
\v 10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and \add the other
\add* five curtains he coupled one unto another. 
\v 11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge
in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of \add another
\add* curtain, in the coupling of the second. 
\v 12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge
of the curtain which \add was\add* in the coupling of the second: the loops
held one \add curtain\add* to another. 
\v 13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one unto
another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.
\p
\v 14 And he made curtains \add of\add* goats’ \add hair\add* for the tent
over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. 
\v 15 The length of one curtain \add was\add* thirty cubits, and four cubits 
\add was\add* the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains \add were
\add* of one size. 
\v 16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by
themselves. 
\v 17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain in the
coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth
the second. 
\v 18 And he made fifty taches \add of\add* brass to couple the tent together,
that it might be one. 
\v 19 And he made a covering for the tent \add of\add* rams’ skins dyed red,
and a covering \add of\add* badgers’ skins above \add that.\add*
\p
\v 20 And he made boards for the tabernacle \add of\add* shittim wood,
standing up. 
\v 21 The length of a board \add was\add* ten cubits, and the breadth of a
board one cubit and a half. 
\v 22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another: thus did he
make for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
\v 23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side
southward: 
\v 24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets
under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for
his two tenons. 
\v 25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, \add which is\add* toward the
north corner, he made twenty boards, 
\v 26 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two
sockets under another board. 
\v 27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six boards. 
\v 28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the two
sides. 
\v 29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head thereof,
to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners. 
\v 30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets \add were\add* sixteen
sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.
\p
\v 31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of
the tabernacle, 
\v 32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and
five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides westward. 
\v 33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the one end
to the other. 
\v 34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings \add of
\add* gold \add to be\add* places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with
gold.
\p
\v 35 And he made a vail \add of\add* blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
twined linen: \add with\add* cherubims made he it of cunning work. 
\v 36 And he made thereunto four pillars \add of\add* shittim \add wood,
\add* and overlaid them with gold: their hooks \add were of\add* gold; and he
cast for them four sockets of silver.
\p
\v 37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door \add of\add* blue, and
purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework; 
\v 38 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid their
chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets \add were of
\add* brass.
\c 37
\p
\v 1 And Bezaleel made the ark \add of\add* shittim wood: two cubits and a
half \add was\add* the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth of it,
and a cubit and a half the height of it: 
\v 2 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made a crown of
gold to it round about. 
\v 3 And he cast for it four rings of gold, \add to be set\add* by the four
corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two rings upon the
other side of it. 
\v 4 And he made staves \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlaid them with
gold. 
\v 5 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the
ark.
\p
\v 6 And he made the mercy seat \add of\add* pure gold: two cubits and a half
\add was\add* the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth
thereof. 
\v 7 And he made two cherubims \add of\add* gold, beaten out of one piece made
he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat; 
\v 8 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the \add other
\add* end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubims on the two
ends thereof. 
\v 9 And the cherubims spread out \add their\add* wings on high, \add and
\add* covered with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to
another; \add even \add*to the mercy seatward were the faces of the
cherubims.
\p
\v 10 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits \add was\add* the
length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the
height thereof: 
\v 11 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown of gold
round about. 
\v 12 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about; and made
a crown of gold for the border thereof round about. 
\v 13 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon the four
corners that \add were\add* in the four feet thereof. 
\v 14 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to
bear the table. 
\v 15 And he made the staves \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlaid them with
gold, to bear the table. 
\v 16 And he made the vessels which \add were\add* upon the table, his dishes,
and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal, \add of
\add* pure gold.
\p
\v 17 And he made the candlestick \add of\add* pure gold: \add of\add* beaten
work made he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his knops,
and his flowers, were of the same: 
\v 18 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the
candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick
out of the other side thereof: 
\v 19 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a knop and
a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a knop and a
flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick. 
\v 20 And in the candlestick \add were\add* four bowls made like almonds, his
knops, and his flowers: 
\v 21 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches
of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six
branches going out of it. 
\v 22 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it \add was
\add* one beaten work \add of\add* pure gold. 
\v 23 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his snuffdishes, 
\add of\add* pure gold. 
\v 24 \add Of\add* a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels
thereof.
\p
\v 25 And he made the incense altar \add of\add* shittim wood: the length of
it \add was\add* a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it \add was
\add* foursquare; and two cubits \add was\add* the height of it; the horns
thereof were of the same. 
\v 26 And he overlaid it with pure gold, \add both\add* the top of it, and the
sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made unto it a crown
of gold round about. 
\v 27 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof, by the two
corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be places for the staves to bear
it withal. 
\v 28 And he made the staves \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlaid them with
gold.
\p
\v 29 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet
spices, according to the work of the apothecary.
\c 38
\p
\v 1 And he made the altar of burnt offering \add of\add* shittim wood: five
cubits \add was\add* the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof;
\add it was\add* foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof. 
\v 2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the horns
thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass. 
\v 3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the shovels, and
the basons, \add and\add* the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the vessels
thereof made he \add of\add* brass. 
\v 4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the compass
thereof beneath unto the midst of it. 
\v 5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, 
\add to be\add* places for the staves. 
\v 6 And he made the staves \add of\add* shittim wood, and overlaid them with
brass. 
\v 7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear
it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.
\p
\v 8 And he made the laver \add of\add* brass, and the foot of it \add of
\add* brass, of the lookingglasses of \add the women\add* assembling, which
assembled \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 9 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings of the
court \add were of\add* fine twined linen, an hundred cubits: 
\v 10 Their pillars \add were\add* twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty;
the hooks of the pillars and their fillets \add were of\add* silver. 
\v 11 And for the north side \add the hangings were\add* an hundred cubits,

\p
\v 21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, \add even\add* of the tabernacle of
testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, 
\add for\add* the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron
the priest. 
\v 22 And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made
all that the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 23 And with him \add was\add* Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of
Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and in
purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen. 
\v 24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the holy
\add place,\add* even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine talents,
and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary. 
\v 25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation 
\add was\add* an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore
and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
\v 26 A bekah for every man, \add that is,\add* half a shekel, after the
shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty
years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and five
hundred and fifty \add men. \add*
\v 27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the
sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the hundred
talents, a talent for a socket. 
\v 28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five \add shekels
\add* he made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and
filleted them. 
\v 29 And the brass of the offering \add was\add* seventy talents, and two
thousand and four hundred shekels. 
\v 30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it, and all the
vessels of the altar, 
\v 31 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of the court
gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of the court round
about.
\c 39
\p
\v 1 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of service, to
do service in the holy \add place,\add* and made the holy garments for Aaron;
as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 2 And he made the ephod \add of\add* gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet,
and fine twined linen. 
\v 3 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut \add it into
\add* wires, to work \add it\add* in the blue, and in the purple, and in the
scarlet, and in the fine linen, \add with\add* cunning work. 
\v 4 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple \add it\add* together: by the
two edges was it coupled together. 
\v 5 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that \add was\add* upon it, 
\add was\add* of the same, according to the work thereof; \add of\add* gold,
blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded
Moses.
\p
\v 6 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold, graven, as
signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. 
\v 7 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, \add that they should be
\add* stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded
Moses.
\p
\v 8 And he made the breastplate \add of\add* cunning work, like the work of
the ephod; \add of\add* gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined
linen. 
\v 9 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span \add was
\add* the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, \add being
\add* doubled. 
\v 10 And they set in it four rows of stones: \add the first\add* row 
\add was\add* a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this \add was\add* the
first row. 
\v 11 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond. 
\v 12 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst. 
\v 13 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: \add they were
\add* inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings. 
\v 14 And the stones \add were\add* according to the names of the children of
Israel, twelve, according to their names, \add like\add* the engravings of a
signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve tribes. 
\v 15 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, \add of
\add* wreathen work \add of\add* pure gold. 
\v 16 And they made two ouches \add of\add* gold, and two gold rings; and put
the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate. 
\v 17 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings on the
ends of the breastplate. 
\v 18 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two
ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, before it. 
\v 19 And they made two rings of gold, and put \add them\add* on the two ends
of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which \add was\add* on the side of
the ephod inward. 
\v 20 And they made two \add other\add* golden rings, and put them on the two
sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over against the 
\add other\add* coupling thereof, above the curious girdle of the ephod. 
\v 21 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the
ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the curious girdle of the
ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the
LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 22 And he made the robe of the ephod \add of\add* woven work, all 
\add of\add* blue. 
\v 23 And \add there was\add* an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of
an habergeon, \add with\add* a band round about the hole, that it should not
rend. 
\v 24 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates \add of\add* blue,
and purple, and scarlet, \add and\add* twined \add linen. \add*
\v 25 And they made bells \add of\add* pure gold, and put the bells between
the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the
pomegranates; 
\v 26 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem
of the robe to minister \add in;\add* as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 27 And they made coats \add of\add* fine linen \add of\add* woven work for
Aaron, and for his sons, 
\v 28 And a mitre \add of\add* fine linen, and goodly bonnets \add of
\add* fine linen, and linen breeches \add of\add* fine twined linen, 
\v 29 And a girdle \add of\add* fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
scarlet, \add of\add* needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 30 And they made the plate of the holy crown \add of\add* pure gold, and
wrote upon it a writing, \add like to\add* the engravings of a signet,
HOLINESS TO THE LORD. 
\v 31 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten \add it\add* on high
upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 32 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation
finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
commanded Moses, so did they.
\p
\v 33 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all his
furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his
sockets, 
\v 34 And the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of badgers’
skins, and the vail of the covering, 
\v 35 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy seat, 
\v 36 The table, \add and\add* all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread, 
\v 37 The pure candlestick, \add with\add* the lamps thereof, \add even with
\add* the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil
for light, 
\v 38 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and
the hanging for the tabernacle door, 
\v 39 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all his
vessels, the laver and his foot, 
\v 40 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging
for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and all the vessels of the
service of the tabernacle, for the tent of the congregation, 
\v 41 The cloths of service to do service in the holy \add place,\add* and the
holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons’ garments, to minister in the
priest’s office. 
\v 42 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of
Israel made all the work. 
\v 43 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they have done it as
the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.
\c 40
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the tabernacle of
the tent of the congregation. 
\v 3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover the ark
with the vail. 
\v 4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things that are
to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the candlestick, and light
the lamps thereof. 
\v 5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of
the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle. 
\v 6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the
tabernacle of the tent of the congregation. 
\v 7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the
altar, and shalt put water therein. 
\v 8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the hanging at
the court gate. 
\v 9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the tabernacle, and all
that \add is\add* therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof:
and it shall be holy. 
\v 10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all his
vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most holy. 
\v 11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it. 
\v 12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation, and wash them with water. 
\v 13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint him, and
sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s office. 
\v 14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats: 
\v 15 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father, that they
may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their anointing shall surely
be an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations. 
\v 16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him, so did
he.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on the first
\add day\add* of the month, \add that\add* the tabernacle was reared up. 
\v 18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set up
the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared up his pillars. 
\v 19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the covering
of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the staves on
the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark: 
\v 21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail of the
covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the side of
the tabernacle northward, without the vail. 
\v 23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the LORD had
commanded Moses.
\p
\v 24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation, over against
the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
\v 25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation before the
vail: 
\v 27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 28 And he set up the hanging \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle. 
\v 29 And he put the altar of burnt offering \add by\add* the door of the
tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt
offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar,
and put water there, to wash \add withal. \add*
\v 31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet
thereat: 
\v 32 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came
near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and
set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the work.
\p
\v 34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the
LORD filled the tabernacle. 
\v 35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation,
because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD filled the
tabernacle. 
\v 36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children
of Israel went onward in all their journeys: 
\v 37 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day
that it was taken up. 
\v 38 For the cloud of the LORD \add was\add* upon the tabernacle by day, and
fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout
all their journeys.
