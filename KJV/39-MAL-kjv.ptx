\v 1 The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi. 
\v 2 I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us?
\add Was\add* not Esau Jacob’s brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob, 
\v 3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the
dragons of the wilderness. 
\v 4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the
desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will
throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The
people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever. 
\v 5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified
from the border of Israel.
\p
\v 6 A son honoureth \add his\add* father, and a servant his master: if then I
\add be\add* a father, where \add is\add* mine honour? and if I \add be
\add* a master, where \add is\add* my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you,
O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy
name? 
\v 7 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we
polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD \add is\add*
contemptible. 
\v 8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, \add is it\add* not evil? and if
ye offer the lame and sick, \add is it\add* not evil? offer it now unto thy
governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD
of hosts. 
\v 9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this
hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of
hosts. 
\v 10 Who \add is there\add* even among you that would shut the doors 
\add for nought?\add* neither do ye kindle \add fire\add* on mine altar for
nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I
accept an offering at your hand. 
\v 11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my
name \add shall be\add* great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense 
\add shall be\add* offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name 
\add shall be\add* great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.
\p
\v 12 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD 
\add is\add* polluted; and the fruit thereof, \add even\add* his meat, 
\add is\add* contemptible. 
\v 13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness \add is it!\add* and ye have
snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought \add that which was
\add* torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I
accept this of your hand? saith the LORD. 
\v 14 But cursed \add be\add* the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male,
and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for I \add am
\add* a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name \add is\add* dreadful
among the heathen.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 And now, O ye priests, this commandment \add is\add* for you. 
\v 2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay \add it\add* to heart, to
give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse
upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already,
because ye do not lay \add it\add* to heart. 
\v 3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, 
\add even\add* the dung of your solemn feasts; and \add one\add* shall take
you away with it. 
\v 4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my
covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him 
\add for\add* the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.
\v 6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his
lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from
iniquity. 
\v 7 For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law
at his mouth: for he \add is\add* the messenger of the LORD of hosts. 
\v 8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the
law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the
people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the
law. 
\v 10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal
treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our
fathers?
\p
\v 11 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in
Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the LORD
which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god. 
\v 12 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the
scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering
unto the LORD of hosts. 
\v 13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD with tears,
with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering
any more, or receiveth \add it\add* with good will at your hand.
\p
\v 14 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness between thee
and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet 
\add is\add* she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant. 
\v 15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And
wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your
spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth. 
\v 16 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for
\add one\add* covereth violence with his garment, saith the LORD of hosts:
therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.
\p
\v 17 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we
wearied \add him?\add* When ye say, Every one that doeth evil \add is
\add* good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or, Where 
\add is\add* the God of judgment?
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me:
and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the
messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith
the LORD of hosts. 
\v 2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he
appeareth? for he \add is\add* like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ sope:
\v 3 And he shall sit \add as\add* a refiner and purifier of silver: and he
shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they
may offer unto the LORD an offering in righteousness. 
\v 4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the LORD,
as in the days of old, and as in former years. 
\v 5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness
against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers,
and against those that oppress the hireling in \add his\add* wages, the widow,
and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger \add from his right,
\add* and fear not me, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 6 For I \add am\add* the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are
not consumed.
\p
\v 7 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances,
and have not kept \add them.\add* Return unto me, and I will return unto you,
saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?
\p
\v 8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we
robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. 
\v 9 Ye \add are\add* cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, \add even
\add* this whole nation. 
\v 10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in
mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not
open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that \add there
shall\add* not \add be room\add* enough \add to receive it. \add*
\v 11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy
the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the
time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 12 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome
land, saith the LORD of hosts.
\p
\v 13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What
have we spoken \add so much\add* against thee? 
\v 14 Ye have said, It \add is\add* vain to serve God: and what profit 
\add is it\add* that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked
mournfully before the LORD of hosts? 
\v 15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set
up; yea, \add they that\add* tempt God are even delivered.
\p
\v 16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD
hearkened, and heard \add it,\add* and a book of remembrance was written
before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name. 
\v 17 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make
up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth
him. 
\v 18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked,
between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and all the
proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble: and the day that
cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them
neither root nor branch.
\p
\v 2 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with
healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the
stall. 
\v 3 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the
soles of your feet in the day that I shall do \add this,\add* saith the LORD
of hosts.
\p
\v 4 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in
Horeb for all Israel, \add with\add* the statutes and judgments.
\p
\v 5 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great
and dreadful day of the LORD: 
\v 6 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart
of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a
curse.
