minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. 
\v 51 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down:
and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the
stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
\v 52 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own
camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. 
\v 53 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony,
that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and
the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. 
\v 54 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded
Moses, so did they.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own standard, with
the ensign of their father’s house: far off about the tabernacle of the
congregation shall they pitch. 
\v 3 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they of the

\add* Eliasaph the son of Reuel. 
\v 15 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, \add were
\add* forty and five thousand and six hundred and fifty. 
\v 16 All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben \add were\add* an hundred
thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and fifty, throughout

Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, every one
after their families, according to the house of their fathers.

\p
\v 1 These also \add are\add* the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day 
\add that\add* the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai. 
\v 2 And these \add are\add* the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the
firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
\v 3 These \add are\add* the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which
were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office. 
\v 4 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire
before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children: and
Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the sight of Aaron
their father.
\p
\v 5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron the priest,
that they may minister unto him. 
\v 7 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation
before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the
tabernacle. 
\v 8 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of
the tabernacle. 
\v 9 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons: they 
\add are\add* wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel. 
\v 10 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their
priest’s office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
\v 11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 12 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of
Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children
of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine; 
\v 13 Because all the firstborn \add are\add* mine; \add for\add* on the day
that I smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the
firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I \add am
\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 14 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying, 
\v 15 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers, by their
families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. 
\v 16 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was
commanded. 
\v 17 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and Kohath, and

\v 23 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle

\p
\v 27 And of Kohath \add was\add* the family of the Amramites, and the family

\p
\v 38 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, \add even

month old and upward, \add were\add* twenty and two thousand.
\p
\v 40 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the males of
the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of
their names. 
\v 41 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I \add am\add* the LORD) instead
of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the
Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of
Israel. 
\v 42 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among
the children of Israel. 
\v 43 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and
upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two
hundred and threescore and thirteen.
\p
\v 44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 45 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of
Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites
shall be mine: I \add am\add* the LORD. 
\v 46 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore
and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of Israel, which are more than
the Levites; 
\v 47 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel
of the sanctuary shalt thou take \add them:\add* (the shekel \add is
\add* twenty gerahs:) 
\v 48 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be
redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons. 
\v 49 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above
them that were redeemed by the Levites: 
\v 50 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money; a thousand
three hundred and threescore and five \add shekels,\add* after the shekel of
the sanctuary: 
\v 51 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to
his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after
their families, by the house of their fathers, 
\v 3 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that
enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 4 This \add shall be\add* the service of the sons of Kohath in the
tabernacle of the congregation, \add about\add* the most holy things:
\p
\v 5 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and
they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with
it: 
\v 6 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers’ skins, and shall spread
over \add it\add* a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves
thereof. 
\v 7 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and
put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover
withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon: 
\v 8 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same
with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put in the staves thereof. 
\v 9 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the
light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil
vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it: 
\v 10 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of
badgers’ skins, and shall put \add it\add* upon a bar. 
\v 11 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover
it with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put to the staves thereof: 
\v 12 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they
minister in the sanctuary, and put \add them\add* in a cloth of blue, and
cover them with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put \add them
\add* on a bar: 
\v 13 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple
cloth thereon: 
\v 14 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they
minister about it, \add even\add* the censers, the fleshhooks, and the
shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread
upon it a covering of badgers skins, and put to the staves of it. 
\v 15 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary,
and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after
that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear \add it:\add* but they shall not
touch \add any\add* holy thing, lest they die. These \add things are
\add* the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 16 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest \add pertaineth
\add* the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat
offering, and the anointing oil, \add and\add* the oversight of all the
tabernacle, and of all that therein \add is,\add* in the sanctuary, and in the
vessels thereof.
\p
\v 17 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 18 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among
the Levites: 
\v 19 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they
approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and
appoint them every one to his service and to his burden: 
\v 20 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest
they die.
\p
\v 21 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 22 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their
fathers, by their families; 
\v 23 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number
them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the
tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 24 This \add is\add* the service of the families of the Gershonites, to
serve, and for burdens: 
\v 25 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle
of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers’ skins that
\add is\add* above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of
the congregation, 
\v 26 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate
of the court, which \add is\add* by the tabernacle and by the altar round
about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that
is made for them: so shall they serve. 
\v 27 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the service of the
sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service: and
ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens. 
\v 28 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the
tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge \add shall be\add* under the
hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
\p
\v 29 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their families,
by the house of their fathers; 
\v 30 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou
number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the
tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 31 And this \add is\add* the charge of their burden, according to all their
service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle,
and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof, 
\v 32 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their
pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service:
and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden. 
\v 33 This \add is\add* the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under
the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.
\p
\v 34 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons
of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of their fathers,
\v 35 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one
that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the
congregation: 
\v 36 And those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand

\v 37 These \add were\add* they that were numbered of the families of the

which Moses and Aaron did number according to the commandment of the LORD by
the hand of Moses. 
\v 38 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their

\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every
leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled by the
dead: 
\v 3 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put
them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I dwell. 
\v 4 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as
the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\p
\v 5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any
sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person be
guilty; 
\v 7 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall
recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto it the fifth
\add part\add* thereof, and give \add it\add* unto \add him\add* against whom
he hath trespassed. 
\v 8 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto, let the
trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, \add even\add* to the priest; beside
the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for him. 
\v 9 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel,
which they bring unto the priest, shall be his. 
\v 10 And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man giveth
the priest, it shall be his.
\p
\v 11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 12 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man’s wife
go aside, and commit a trespass against him, 
\v 13 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her
husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and \add there be\add* no
witness against her, neither she be taken \add with the manner; \add*
\v 14 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife,
and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be
jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled: 
\v 15 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring
her offering for her, the tenth \add part\add* of an ephah of barley meal; he
shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it \add is
\add* an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to
remembrance. 
\v 16 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD: 
\v 17 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the
dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put 
\add it\add* into the water: 
\v 18 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the
woman’s head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which \add is
\add* the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter
water that causeth the curse: 
\v 19 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the woman, If
no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness 
\add with another\add* instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter
water that causeth the curse: 
\v 20 But if thou hast gone aside \add to another\add* instead of thy husband,
and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine
husband: 
\v 21 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the
priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among
thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;
\v 22 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make
\add thy\add* belly to swell, and \add thy\add* thigh to rot: And the woman
shall say, Amen, amen. 
\v 23 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot 
\add them\add* out with the bitter water: 
\v 24 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the
curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, \add and
become\add* bitter. 
\v 25 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the woman’s
hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the
altar: 
\v 26 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, \add even
\add* the memorial thereof, and burn \add it\add* upon the altar, and
afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water. 
\v 27 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to
pass, \add that,\add* if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her
husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, 
\add and become\add* bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall
rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. 
\v 28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free,
and shall conceive seed. 
\v 29 This \add is\add* the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside 
\add to another\add* instead of her husband, and is defiled; 
\v 30 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be jealous over
his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall
execute upon her all this law. 
\v 31 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear
her iniquity.

\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either man or
woman shall separate \add themselves\add* to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to
separate \add themselves\add* unto the LORD: 
\v 3 He shall separate \add himself\add* from wine and strong drink, and shall
drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink
any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried. 
\v 4 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the
vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk. 
\v 5 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon
his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth \add himself
\add* unto the LORD, he shall be holy, \add and\add* shall let the locks of
the hair of his head grow. 
\v 6 All the days that he separateth \add himself\add* unto the LORD he shall
come at no dead body. 
\v 7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for
his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his
God \add is\add* upon his head. 
\v 8 All the days of his separation he \add is\add* holy unto the LORD. 
\v 9 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the head of
his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing, on
the seventh day shall he shave it. 
\v 10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons,
to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for
a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he sinned by the
dead, and shall hallow his head that same day. 
\v 12 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his separation, and
shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering: but the days
that were before shall be lost, because his separation was defiled.
\p
\v 13 And this \add is\add* the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation: 
\v 14 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of the first
year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year
without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace
offerings, 
\v 15 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil,
and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their meat offering, and
their drink offerings. 
\v 16 And the priest shall bring \add them\add* before the LORD, and shall
offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering: 
\v 17 And he shall offer the ram \add for\add* a sacrifice of peace offerings
unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall offer
also his meat offering, and his drink offering. 
\v 18 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation \add at
\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair
of the head of his separation, and put \add it\add* in the fire which 
\add is\add* under the sacrifice of the peace offerings. 
\v 19 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and one
unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and shall put 
\add them\add* upon the hands of the Nazarite, after \add the hair of
\add* his separation is shaven: 
\v 20 And the priest shall wave them \add for\add* a wave offering before the
LORD: this \add is\add* holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave
shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine. 
\v 21 This \add is\add* the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, \add and of
\add* his offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that \add that
\add* his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do
after the law of his separation.
\p
\v 22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 23 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye shall bless
the children of Israel, saying unto them, 
\v 24 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee: 
\v 25 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: 
\v 26 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. 
\v 27 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I will bless
them.

\p
\v 1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the instruments
thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had anointed them,
and sanctified them; 
\v 2 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who 
\add were\add* the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were
numbered, offered: 
\v 3 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and
twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they
brought them before the tabernacle. 
\v 4 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 5 Take \add it\add* of them, that they may be to do the service of the
tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to
every man according to his service. 
\v 6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. 
\v 7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to
their service: 
\v 8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according
unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 
\v 9 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the
sanctuary belonging unto them \add was that\add* they should bear upon their
shoulders.
\p
\v 10 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it
was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar.

prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the
seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick. 
\v 3 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the
candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 4 And this work of the candlestick \add was of\add* beaten gold, unto the
shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, \add was\add* beaten work: according
unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick.
\p
\v 5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 6 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. 
\v 7 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of
purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash
their clothes, and \add so\add* make themselves clean. 
\v 8 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, \add even
\add* fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take
for a sin offering. 
\v 9 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of
Israel together: 
\v 10 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of
Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites: 
\v 11 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD \add for\add* an
offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the
LORD. 
\v 12 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks:
and thou shalt offer the one \add for\add* a sin offering, and the other 
\add for\add* a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the
Levites. 
\v 13 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and
offer them \add for\add* an offering unto the LORD. 
\v 14 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel:
and the Levites shall be mine. 
\v 15 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the
tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them 
\add for\add* an offering. 
\v 16 For they \add are\add* wholly given unto me from among the children of
Israel; instead of such as open every womb, \add even instead of\add* the
firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. 
\v 17 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel \add are\add* mine, 
\add both\add* man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the
land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. 
\v 18 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of
Israel. 
\v 19 And I have given the Levites \add as\add* a gift to Aaron and to his
sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of
Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the
children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when
the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary. 
\v 20 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of
Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses
concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. 
\v 21 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron
offered them \add as\add* an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an
atonement for them to cleanse them. 
\v 22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle
of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had
commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.
\p
\v 23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 24 This \add is it\add* that \add belongeth\add* unto the Levites: from
twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service
of the tabernacle of the congregation: 
\v 25 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the
service \add thereof,\add* and shall serve no more: 
\v 26 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the
congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do
unto the Levites touching their charge.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first
month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt,
saying, 
\v 2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his appointed
season. 
\v 3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in his
appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to all the
ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it. 
\v 4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the
passover. 
\v 5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at
even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded
Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\p
\v 6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man,
that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses
and before Aaron on that day: 
\v 7 And those men said unto him, We \add are\add* defiled by the dead body of
a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the
LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel? 
\v 8 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will
command concerning you.
\p
\v 9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 10 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your
posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or \add be\add* in a
journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD. 
\v 11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, 
\add and\add* eat it with unleavened bread and bitter \add herbs. \add*
\v 12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it:
according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. 
\v 13 But the man that \add is\add* clean, and is not in a journey, and
forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from
among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his
appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. 
\v 14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover
unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to
the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the
stranger, and for him that was born in the land.
\p
\v 15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the
tabernacle, \add namely,\add* the tent of the testimony: and at even there was
upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning. 
\v 16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it \add by day,\add* and the
appearance of fire by night. 
\v 17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the
children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there
the children of Israel pitched their tents. 
\v 18 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at
the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the
tabernacle they rested in their tents. 
\v 19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the
children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. 
\v 20 And \add so\add* it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the
tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their
tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. 
\v 21 And \add so\add* it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the
morning, and \add that\add* the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they
journeyed: whether \add it was\add* by day or by night that the cloud was
taken up, they journeyed. 
\v 22 Or \add whether it were\add* two days, or a month, or a year, that the
cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel
abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they
journeyed. 
\v 23 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the
commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at
the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them:
that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the
journeying of the camps. 
\v 3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble
themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 4 And if they blow \add but\add* with one \add trumpet,\add* then the
princes, \add which are\add* heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather
themselves unto thee. 
\v 5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go
forward. 
\v 6 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the
south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their
journeys. 
\v 7 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but
ye shall not sound an alarm. 
\v 8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and
they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. 
\v 9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you,
then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered
before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. 
\v 10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the
beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt
offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be
to you for a memorial before your God: I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 11 And it came to pass on the twentieth \add day\add* of the second month,
in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the
testimony. 
\v 12 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of
Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran. 
\v 13 And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the
LORD by the hand of Moses.
\p
\v 14 In the first \add place\add* went the standard of the camp of the
children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host \add was
\add* Nahshon the son of Amminadab. 
\v 15 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar \add was
\add* Nethaneel the son of Zuar. 
\v 16 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun \add was
\add* Eliab the son of Helon. 
\v 17 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons
of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.
\p
\v 18 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their
armies: and over his host \add was\add* Elizur the son of Shedeur. 
\v 19 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel
the son of Zurishaddai. 
\v 20 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the
son of Deuel. 
\v 21 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and \add the
other\add* did set up the tabernacle against they came.
\p
\v 22 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward
according to their armies: and over his host \add was\add* Elishama the son of
Ammihud. 
\v 23 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh \add was
\add* Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur. 
\v 24 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin \add was
\add* Abidan the son of Gideoni.
\p
\v 25 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, 
\add which was\add* the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts: and
over his host \add was\add* Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai. 
\v 26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher \add was
\add* Pagiel the son of Ocran. 
\v 27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali \add was
\add* Ahira the son of Enan. 
\v 28 Thus \add were\add* the journeyings of the children of Israel according
to their armies, when they set forward.
\p
\v 29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses’
father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will
give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath
spoken good concerning Israel. 
\v 30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own land,
and to my kindred. 
\v 31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest how we
are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes. 
\v 32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what
goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.
\p
\v 33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey: and
the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days’
journey, to search out a resting place for them. 
\v 34 And the cloud of the LORD \add was\add* upon them by day, when they went
out of the camp. 
\v 35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up,
LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee
before thee. 
\v 36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of
Israel.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 And \add when\add* the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the
LORD heard \add it;\add* and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD
burnt among them, and consumed \add them that were\add* in the uttermost parts
of the camp. 
\v 2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the LORD, the
fire was quenched. 
\v 3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD
burnt among them.
\p
\v 4 And the mixt multitude that \add was\add* among them fell a lusting: and
the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to
eat? 
\v 5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the cucumbers,
and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: 
\v 6 But now our soul \add is\add* dried away: \add there is\add* nothing at
all, beside this manna, \add before\add* our eyes. 
\v 7 And the manna \add was\add* as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
the colour of bdellium. 
\v 8 \add And\add* the people went about, and gathered \add it,\add* and
ground \add it\add* in mills, or beat \add it\add* in a mortar, and baked 
\add it\add* in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the
taste of fresh oil. 
\v 9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon
it.
\p
\v 10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in
the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; Moses
also was displeased. 
\v 11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant?
and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the
burden of all this people upon me? 
\v 12 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou
shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth
the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 
\v 13 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep
unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 
\v 14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because \add it is
\add* too heavy for me. 
\v 15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I
have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
\p
\v 16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders
of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over
them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may
stand there with thee. 
\v 17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the
spirit which \add is\add* upon thee, and will put \add it\add* upon them; and
they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not
thyself alone. 
\v 18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and
ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who
shall give us flesh to eat? for \add it was\add* well with us in Egypt:
therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. 
\v 19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days,
nor twenty days; 
\v 20 \add But\add* even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils,
and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which 
\add is\add* among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth
out of Egypt? 
\v 21 And Moses said, The people, among whom I \add am, are\add* six hundred
thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may
eat a whole month. 
\v 22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or
shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
\v 23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD’S hand waxed short? thou shalt
see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.
\p
\v 24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and
gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about
the tabernacle. 
\v 25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the
spirit that \add was\add* upon him, and gave \add it\add* unto the seventy
elders: and it came to pass, \add that,\add* when the spirit rested upon them,
they prophesied, and did not cease. 
\v 26 But there remained two \add of the\add* men in the camp, the name of the
one \add was\add* Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit
rested upon them; and they \add were\add* of them that were written, but went
not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. 
\v 27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do
prophesy in the camp. 
\v 28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, \add one\add* of his
young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them. 
\v 29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all
the LORD’S people were prophets, \add and\add* that the LORD would put his
spirit upon them! 
\v 30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
\p
\v 31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the
sea, and let \add them\add* fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey on
this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side, round about the
camp, and as it were two cubits \add high\add* upon the face of the earth. 
\v 32 And the people stood up all that day, and all \add that\add* night, and
all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least
gathered ten homers: and they spread \add them\add* all abroad for themselves
round about the camp. 
\v 33 And while the flesh \add was\add* yet between their teeth, ere it was
chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD
smote the people with a very great plague. 
\v 34 And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there
they buried the people that lusted. 
\v 35 \add And\add* the people journeyed from Kibroth- hattaavah unto
Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman
whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman. 
\v 2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not
spoken also by us? And the LORD heard \add it. \add*
\v 3 (Now the man Moses \add was\add* very meek, above all the men which 
\add were\add* upon the face of the earth.) 
\v 4 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam,
Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came
out. 
\v 5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door
of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth. 
\v 6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, 
\add I\add* the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, \add and
\add* will speak unto him in a dream. 
\v 7 My servant Moses \add is\add* not so, who \add is\add* faithful in all
mine house. 
\v 8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark
speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: wherefore then were
ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? 
\v 9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed. 
\v 10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam 
\add became\add* leprous, \add white\add* as snow: and Aaron looked upon
Miriam, and, behold, \add she was\add* leprous. 
\v 11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the
sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned. 
\v 12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he
cometh out of his mother’s womb. 
\v 13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech
thee.
\p
\v 14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face,
should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven
days, and after that let her be received in \add again. \add*
\v 15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people
journeyed not till Miriam was brought in \add again. \add*
\v 16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the
wilderness of Paran.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto
the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man,
every one a ruler among them. 
\v 3 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of
Paran: all those men \add were\add* heads of the children of Israel. 
\v 4 And these \add were\add* their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the
son of Zaccur. 
\v 5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. 
\v 6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
\v 7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. 
\v 8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. 
\v 9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. 
\v 10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. 
\v 11 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son
of Susi. 
\v 12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. 
\v 13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. 
\v 14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. 
\v 15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 
\v 16 These \add are\add* the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.
\p
\v 17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them,
Get you up this \add way\add* southward, and go up into the mountain: 
\v 18 And see the land, what it \add is;\add* and the people that dwelleth
therein, whether they \add be\add* strong or weak, few or many; 
\v 19 And what the land \add is\add* that they dwell in, whether it 
\add be\add* good or bad; and what cities \add they be\add* that they dwell
in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; 
\v 20 And what the land \add is,\add* whether it \add be\add* fat or lean,
whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of
the fruit of the land. Now the time \add was\add* the time of the firstripe
grapes.
\p
\v 21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto
Rehob, as men come to Hamath. 
\v 22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman,
Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, \add were.\add* (Now Hebron was
built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
\v 23 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a
branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff;
and \add they brought\add* of the pomegranates, and of the figs. 
\v 24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes
which the children of Israel cut down from thence. 
\v 25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
\p
\v 26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to
Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and
shewed them the fruit of the land. 
\v 27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest
us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this \add is\add* the fruit
of it. 
\v 28 Nevertheless the people \add be\add* strong that dwell in the land, and
the cities \add are\add* walled, \add and\add* very great: and moreover we saw
the children of Anak there. 
\v 29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the
Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell
by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. 
\v 30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at
once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. 
\v 31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against
the people; for they are stronger than we. 
\v 32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched
unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to
search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the
people that we saw in it \add are\add* men of a great stature. 
\v 33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, \add which come
\add* of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we
were in their sight.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people
wept that night. 
\v 2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron:
and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the
land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! 
\v 3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the
sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better
for us to return into Egypt? 
\v 4 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return
into Egypt. 
\v 5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the
congregation of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, \add which
were\add* of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 
\v 7 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying,
The land, which we passed through to search it, \add is\add* an exceeding good
land. 
\v 8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give
it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. 
\v 9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the
land; for they \add are\add* bread for us: their defence is departed from
them, and the LORD \add is\add* with us: fear them not. 
\v 10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of
the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the
children of Israel.
\p
\v 11 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and
how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed
among them? 
\v 12 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will
make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
\p
\v 13 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear \add it,
\add* (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) 
\v 14 And they will tell \add it\add* to the inhabitants of this land: 
\add for\add* they have heard that thou LORD \add art\add* among this people,
that thou LORD art seen face to face, and \add that\add* thy cloud standeth
over them, and \add that\add* thou goest before them, by daytime in a pillar
of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\p
\v 15 Now \add if\add* thou shalt kill \add all\add* this people as one man,
then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 
\v 16 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which
he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. 
\v 17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as
thou hast spoken, saying, 
\v 18 The LORD \add is\add* longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving
iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing \add the guilty,
\add* visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third
and fourth \add generation. \add*
\v 19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the
greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even
until now. 
\v 20 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 
\v 21 But \add as\add* truly \add as\add* I live, all the earth shall be
filled with the glory of the LORD. 
\v 22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I
did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times,
and have not hearkened to my voice; 
\v 23 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers,
neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: 
\v 24 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath
followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his
seed shall possess it. 
\v 25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To morrow
turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
\p
\v 26 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 27 How long \add shall I bear with\add* this evil congregation, which
murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel,
which they murmur against me. 
\v 28 Say unto them, \add As truly as\add* I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 
\v 29 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered
of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward,
which have murmured against me, 
\v 30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, \add concerning\add* which I
sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua
the son of Nun. 
\v 31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring
in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. 
\v 32 But \add as for\add* you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
wilderness. 
\v 33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear
your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. 
\v 34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, \add even
\add* forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, 
\add even\add* forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. 
\v 35 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they
shall be consumed, and there they shall die. 
\v 36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made
all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the
land, 
\v 37 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by
the plague before the LORD. 
\v 38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, \add which
were\add* of the men that went to search the land, lived \add still. 
\add*
\v 39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the
people mourned greatly.
\p
\v 40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of
the mountain, saying, Lo, we \add be here,\add* and will go up unto the place
which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. 
\v 41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the
LORD? but it shall not prosper. 
\v 42 Go not up, for the LORD \add is\add* not among you; that ye be not
smitten before your enemies. 
\v 43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites \add are\add* there before you,
and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD,
therefore the LORD will not be with you. 
\v 44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of
the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. 
\v 45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that
hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, \add even\add* unto Hormah.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come
into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you, 
\v 3 And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a
sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn
feasts, to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock: 
\v 4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a meat
offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth \add part
\add* of an hin of oil. 
\v 5 And the fourth \add part\add* of an hin of wine for a drink offering
shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb. 
\v 6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare \add for\add* a meat offering two tenth
deals of flour mingled with the third \add part\add* of an hin of oil. 
\v 7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third \add part\add* of an
hin of wine, \add for\add* a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
\v 8 And when thou preparest a bullock \add for\add* a burnt offering, or 
\add for\add* a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the
LORD: 
\v 9 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals
of flour mingled with half an hin of oil. 
\v 10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an
offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
\v 11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or
a kid. 
\v 12 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to every
one according to their number. 
\v 13 All that are born of the country shall do these things after this
manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the
LORD. 
\v 14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever \add be\add* among you
in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet
savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do. 
\v 15 One ordinance \add shall be both\add* for you of the congregation, and
also for the stranger that sojourneth \add with you,\add* an ordinance for
ever in your generations: as ye \add are,\add* so shall the stranger be before
the LORD. 
\v 16 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that
sojourneth with you.
\p
\v 17 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 18 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into
the land whither I bring you, 
\v 19 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land, ye shall
offer up an heave offering unto the LORD. 
\v 20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough \add for\add* an
heave offering: as \add ye do\add* the heave offering of the threshingfloor,
so shall ye heave it. 
\v 21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave offering
in your generations.
\p
\v 22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the
LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 
\v 23 \add Even all\add* that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of
Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded \add Moses,\add* and henceforward
among your generations; 
\v 24 Then it shall be, if \add ought\add* be committed by ignorance without
the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one
young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with his
meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of
the goats for a sin offering. 
\v 25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the
children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and
they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and
their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance: 
\v 26 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel,
and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people \add were
\add* in ignorance.
\p
\v 27 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of
the first year for a sin offering. 
\v 28 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth
ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement
for him; and it shall be forgiven him. 
\v 29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance, 
\add both for\add* him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the
stranger that sojourneth among them.
\p
\v 30 But the soul that doeth \add ought\add* presumptuously, \add whether he
be\add* born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the LORD; and
that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 
\v 31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken his
commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity \add shall be
\add* upon him.
\p
\v 32 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a
man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. 
\v 33 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and
Aaron, and unto all the congregation. 
\v 34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be
done to him. 
\v 35 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all
the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. 
\v 36 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him
with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 37 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 38 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them
fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and
that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 
\v 39 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and
remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not
after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring: 
\v 40 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your
God. 
\v 41 I \add am\add* the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
Egypt, to be your God: I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and
Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of
Reuben, took \add men: \add*
\v 2 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel,
two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men
of renown: 
\v 3 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron,
and said unto them, \add Ye take\add* too much upon you, seeing all the
congregation \add are\add* holy, every one of them, and the LORD \add is
\add* among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation
of the LORD? 
\v 4 And when Moses heard \add it,\add* he fell upon his face: 
\v 5 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow
the LORD will shew who \add are\add* his, and \add who is\add* holy; and will
cause \add him\add* to come near unto him: even \add him\add* whom he hath
chosen will he cause to come near unto him. 
\v 6 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; 
\v 7 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow:
and it shall be \add that\add* the man whom the LORD doth choose, he 
\add shall be\add* holy: \add ye take\add* too much upon you, ye sons of
Levi. 
\v 8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi: 
\v 9 \add Seemeth it but\add* a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to
himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before
the congregation to minister unto them? 
\v 10 And he hath brought thee near \add to him,\add* and all thy brethren the
sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also? 
\v 11 For which cause \add both\add* thou and all thy company \add are
\add* gathered together against the LORD: and what \add is\add* Aaron, that ye
murmur against him?
\p
\v 12 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said,
We will not come up: 
\v 13 \add Is it\add* a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land
that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou
make thyself altogether a prince over us? 
\v 14 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and
honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the
eyes of these men? we will not come up. 
\v 15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their
offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of
them. 
\v 16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD,
thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 
\v 17 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye
before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou
also, and Aaron, each \add of you\add* his censer. 
\v 18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid
incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
with Moses and Aaron. 
\v 19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto
all the congregation. 
\v 20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 21 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume
them in a moment. 
\v 22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits
of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the
congregation?
\p
\v 23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. 
\v 25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of
Israel followed him. 
\v 26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the
tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in
all their sins. 
\v 27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on
every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their
tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. 
\v 28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do
all these works; for \add I have\add* not \add done them\add* of mine own
mind. 
\v 29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited
after the visitation of all men; \add then\add* the LORD hath not sent me. 
\v 30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and
swallow them up, with all that \add appertain\add* unto them, and they go down
quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the
LORD.
\p
\v 31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words,
that the ground clave asunder that \add was\add* under them: 
\v 32 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,
and all the men that \add appertained\add* unto Korah, and all \add their
\add* goods. 
\v 33 They, and all that \add appertained\add* to them, went down alive into
the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the
congregation. 
\v 34 And all Israel that \add were\add* round about them fled at the cry of
them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up \add also. \add*
\v 35 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred
and fifty men that offered incense.
\p
\v 36 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 37 Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the
censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are
hallowed. 
\v 38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them
broad plates \add for\add* a covering of the altar: for they offered them
before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto
the children of Israel. 
\v 39 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were
burnt had offered; and they were made broad \add plates for\add* a covering of
the altar: 
\v 40 \add To be\add* a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no
stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before
the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him
by the hand of Moses.
\p
\v 41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of
the LORD. 
\v 42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses
and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation:
and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. 
\v 43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 45 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a
moment. And they fell upon their faces.
\p
\v 46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off
the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make
an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague
is begun. 
\v 47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the
congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put
on incense, and made an atonement for the people. 
\v 48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was
stayed. 
\v 49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven
hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah. 
\v 50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation: and the plague was stayed.
\c 17
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod
according to the house of \add their\add* fathers, of all their princes
according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man’s
name upon his rod. 
\v 3 And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod 
\add shall be\add* for the head of the house of their fathers. 
\v 4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before
the testimony, where I will meet with you. 
\v 5 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* the man’s rod, whom I shall
choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the
children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.
\p
\v 6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their
princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their
fathers’ houses, \add even\add* twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron \add was
\add* among their rods. 
\v 7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.
\v 8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of
witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and
brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds. 
\v 9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the
children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.
\p
\v 10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron’s rod again before the
testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite
take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. 
\v 11 And Moses did \add so:\add* as the LORD commanded him, so did he. 
\v 12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we
perish, we all perish. 
\v 13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall
die: shall we be consumed with dying?
\c 18
\p
\v 1 And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father’s house
with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with
thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. 
\v 2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father,
bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto
thee: but thou and thy sons with thee \add shall minister\add* before the
tabernacle of witness. 
\v 3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle:
only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that
neither they, nor ye also, die. 
\v 4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle
of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger
shall not come nigh unto you. 
\v 5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the
altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel. 
\v 6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the
children of Israel: to you \add they are\add* given \add as\add* a gift for
the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s office for
every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have
given your priest’s office \add unto you as\add* a service of gift: and the
stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
\p
\v 8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge
of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel;
unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an
ordinance for ever. 
\v 9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, \add reserved\add* from the
fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin
offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall
render unto me, \add shall be\add* most holy for thee and for thy sons. 
\v 10 In the most holy \add place\add* shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat
it: it shall be holy unto thee. 
\v 11 And this \add is\add* thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all
the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto thee, and
to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one
that is clean in thy house shall eat of it. 
\v 12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat,
the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the LORD, them have I
given thee. 
\v 13 \add And\add* whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall
bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house
shall eat \add of\add* it. 
\v 14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine. 
\v 15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto
the LORD, \add whether it be\add* of men or beasts, shall be thine:
nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling
of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem. 
\v 16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem,
according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel
of the sanctuary, which \add is\add* twenty gerahs. 
\v 17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the
firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they \add are\add* holy: thou
shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat 
\add for\add* an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD. 
\v 18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the
right shoulder are thine. 
\v 19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel
offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with
thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD
unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
\p
\v 20 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their
land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I \add am\add* thy part and
thine inheritance among the children of Israel. 
\v 21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel
for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, \add even\add* the
service of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle
of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die. 
\v 23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: \add it shall be\add* a
statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of
Israel they have no inheritance. 
\v 24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer \add as
\add* an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit:
therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have
no inheritance.
\p
\v 25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 26 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the
children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your
inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, 
\add even\add* a tenth \add part\add* of the tithe. 
\v 27 And \add this\add* your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as
though \add it were\add* the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of
the winepress. 
\v 28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all your
tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof
the LORD’S heave offering to Aaron the priest. 
\v 29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the LORD,
of all the best thereof, \add even\add* the hallowed part thereof out of it. 
\v 30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof
from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the
threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress. 
\v 31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it 
\add is\add* your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the
congregation. 
\v 32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it
the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of
Israel, lest ye die.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
\v 2 This \add is\add* the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded,
saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer
without spot, wherein \add is\add* no blemish, \add and\add* upon which never
came yoke: 
\v 3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her
forth without the camp, and \add one\add* shall slay her before his face: 
\v 4 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and
sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven
times: 
\v 5 And \add one\add* shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her
flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: 
\v 6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast 
\add it\add* into the midst of the burning of the heifer. 
\v 7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in
water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be
unclean until the even. 
\v 8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his
flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. 
\v 9 And a man \add that is\add* clean shall gather up the ashes of the
heifer, and lay \add them\add* up without the camp in a clean place, and it
shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of
separation: it \add is\add* a purification for sin. 
\v 10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes,
and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel,
and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever.
\p
\v 11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. 
\v 12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day
he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the
seventh day he shall not be clean. 
\v 13 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth
not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut
off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him,
he shall be unclean; his uncleanness \add is\add* yet upon him. 
\v 14 This \add is\add* the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come
into the tent, and all that \add is\add* in the tent, shall be unclean seven
days. 
\v 15 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, \add is
\add* unclean. 
\v 16 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open
fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven
days. 
\v 17 And for an unclean \add person\add* they shall take of the ashes of the
burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto
in a vessel: 
\v 18 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip \add it\add* in the water,
and sprinkle \add it\add* upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon
the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain,
or one dead, or a grave: 
\v 19 And the clean \add person\add* shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the
third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify
himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean
at even. 
\v 20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that
soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the
sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon
him; he \add is\add* unclean. 
\v 21 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth
the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water
of separation shall be unclean until even. 
\v 22 And whatsoever the unclean \add person\add* toucheth shall be unclean;
and the soul that toucheth \add it\add* shall be unclean until even.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Then came the children of Israel, \add even\add* the whole congregation,
into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and
Miriam died there, and was buried there. 
\v 2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves
together against Moses and against Aaron. 
\v 3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had
died when our brethren died before the LORD! 
\v 4 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this
wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? 
\v 5 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in
unto this evil place? it \add is\add* no place of seed, or of figs, or of
vines, or of pomegranates; neither \add is\add* there any water to drink. 
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the
glory of the LORD appeared unto them.
\p
\v 7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 8 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy
brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth
his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou
shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. 
\v 9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. 
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock,
and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of
this rock? 
\v 11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice:
and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their
beasts \add also.\add*
\p
\v 12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to
sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not
bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. 
\v 13 This \add is\add* the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.
\p
\v 14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith
thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: 
\v 15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long
time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers: 
\v 16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel,
and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we \add are\add* in
Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 
\v 17 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through
the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink \add of
\add* the water of the wells: we will go by the king’s \add high\add* way, we
will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy
borders. 
\v 18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out
against thee with the sword. 
\v 19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way:
and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will
only, without \add doing\add* any thing \add else,\add* go through on my
feet. 
\v 20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him
with much people, and with a strong hand. 
\v 21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore
Israel turned away from him.
\p
\v 22 And the children of Israel, \add even\add* the whole congregation,
journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. 
\v 23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of
the land of Edom, saying, 
\v 24 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the
land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled
against my word at the water of Meribah. 
\v 25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: 
\v 26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and
Aaron shall be gathered \add unto his people,\add* and shall die there. 
\v 27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in
the sight of all the congregation. 
\v 28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his
son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came
down from the mount. 
\v 29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for
Aaron thirty days, \add even\add* all the house of Israel.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 And \add when\add* king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,
heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against
Israel, and took \add some\add* of them prisoners. 
\v 2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed
deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. 
\v 3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the
Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called
the name of the place Hormah.
\p
\v 4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass
the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of
the way. 
\v 5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye
brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for \add there is
\add* no bread, neither \add is there any\add* water; and our soul loatheth
this light bread. 
\v 6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the
people; and much people of Israel died.
\p
\v 7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have
spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD, that he take
away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. 
\v 8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon
a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he
looketh upon it, shall live. 
\v 9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to
pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of
brass, he lived.
\p
\v 10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth. 
\v 11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the
wilderness which \add is\add* before Moab, toward the sunrising.
\p
\v 12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. 
\v 13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which
\add is\add* in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites:
for Arnon \add is\add* the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 
\v 14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in
the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 
\v 15 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar,
and lieth upon the border of Moab. 
\v 16 And from thence \add they went\add* to Beer: that \add is\add* the well
whereof the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give
them water.
\p
\v 17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it: 
\v 18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by 
\add the direction of\add* the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the
wilderness \add they went\add* to Mattanah: 
\v 19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 
\v 20 And from Bamoth \add in\add* the valley, that \add is\add* in the
country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.
\p
\v 21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, 
\v 22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into
the vineyards; we will not drink \add of\add* the waters of the well: 
\add but\add* we will go along by the king’s \add high\add* way, until we be
past thy borders. 
\v 23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon
gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the
wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel. 
\v 24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land
from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the
children of Ammon \add was\add* strong. 
\v 25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of
the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof. 
\v 26 For Heshbon \add was\add* the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,
who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of
his hand, even unto Arnon. 
\v 27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the
city of Sihon be built and prepared: 
\v 28 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon:
it hath consumed Ar of Moab, \add and\add* the lords of the high places of
Arnon. 
\v 29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given
his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of
the Amorites. 
\v 30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we have
laid them waste even unto Nophah, which \add reacheth\add* unto Medeba.
\p
\v 31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. 
\v 32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof,
and drove out the Amorites that \add were\add* there.
\p
\v 33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of
Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
\v 34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him
into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as
thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 
\v 35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was
none left him alive: and they possessed his land.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab
on this side Jordan \add by\add* Jericho.
\p
\v 2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
Amorites. 
\v 3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they \add were
\add* many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. 
\v 4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up
all \add that are\add* round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the
field. And Balak the son of Zippor \add was\add* king of the Moabites at that
time. 
\v 5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which
\add is\add* by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call
him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover
the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: 
\v 6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they 
\add are\add* too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, \add that
\add* we may smite them, and \add that\add* I may drive them out of the land:
for I wot that he whom thou blessest \add is\add* blessed, and he whom thou
cursest is cursed. 
\v 7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards
of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the
words of Balak. 
\v 8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word
again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with
Balaam. 
\v 9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men \add are\add* these with
thee? 
\v 10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath
sent unto me, \add saying, \add*
\v 11 Behold, \add there is\add* a people come out of Egypt, which covereth
the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able
to overcome them, and drive them out. 
\v 12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not
curse the people: for they \add are\add* blessed. 
\v 13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak,
Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with
you. 
\v 14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said,
Balaam refuseth to come with us.
\p
\v 15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. 
\v 16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of
Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: 
\v 17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever
thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 
\v 18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would
give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the
LORD my God, to do less or more. 
\v 19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may
know what the LORD will say unto me more. 
\v 20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to
call thee, rise up, \add and\add* go with them; but yet the word which I shall
say unto thee, that shalt thou do. 
\v 21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with
the princes of Moab.
\p
\v 22 And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD
stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass,
and his two servants \add were\add* with him. 
\v 23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword
drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the
field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. 
\v 24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall 
\add being\add* on this side, and a wall on that side. 
\v 25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the
wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again. 
\v 26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place,
where \add was\add* no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 
\v 27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam:
and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff. 
\v 28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What
have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? 
\v 29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there
were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee. 
\v 30 And the ass said unto Balaam, \add Am\add* not I thine ass, upon which
thou hast ridden ever since \add I was\add* thine unto this day? was I ever
wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. 
\v 31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the
LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down
his head, and fell flat on his face. 
\v 32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten
thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because 
\add thy\add* way is perverse before me: 
\v 33 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had
turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. 
\v 34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew
not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease
thee, I will get me back again. 
\v 35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only
the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went
with the princes of Balak.
\p
\v 36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto
a city of Moab, which \add is\add* in the border of Arnon, which \add is
\add* in the utmost coast. 
\v 37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call
thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee
to honour? 
\v 38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any
power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that
shall I speak. 
\v 39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth. 
\v 40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes
that \add were\add* with him. 
\v 41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought
him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost 
\add part\add* of the people.
\c 23
\p
\v 1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me
here seven oxen and seven rams. 
\v 2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on 
\add every\add* altar a bullock and a ram. 
\v 3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go:
peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he sheweth me I
will tell thee. And he went to an high place. 
\v 4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars,
and I have offered upon \add every\add* altar a bullock and a ram. 
\v 5 And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said, Return unto Balak,
and thus thou shalt speak. 
\v 6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he,
and all the princes of Moab. 
\v 7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought
me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, \add saying,\add* Come, curse
me Jacob, and come, defy Israel. 
\v 8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, 
\add whom\add* the LORD hath not defied? 
\v 9 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold him:
lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among the
nations. 
\v 10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth 
\add part\add* of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my
last end be like his! 
\v 11 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to
curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed \add them\add* altogether.
\v 12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the
LORD hath put in my mouth? 
\v 13 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place,
from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them,
and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
\p
\v 14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and
built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on \add every\add* altar.
\v 15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet 
\add the LORD\add* yonder. 
\v 16 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go again
unto Balak, and say thus. 
\v 17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering, and the
princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?
\v 18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken
unto me, thou son of Zippor: 
\v 19 God \add is\add* not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man,
that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do \add it?\add* or hath
he spoken, and shall he not make it good? 
\v 20 Behold, I have received \add commandment\add* to bless: and he hath
blessed; and I cannot reverse it. 
\v 21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness
in Israel: the LORD his God \add is\add* with him, and the shout of a king 
\add is\add* among them. 
\v 22 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an
unicorn. 
\v 23 Surely \add there is\add* no enchantment against Jacob, neither 
\add is there\add* any divination against Israel: according to this time it
shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought! 
\v 24 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as
a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat \add of\add* the prey, and
drink the blood of the slain.
\p
\v 25 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at
all. 
\v 26 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All
that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?
\p
\v 27 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto
another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them
from thence. 
\v 28 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward
Jeshimon. 
\v 29 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare me
here seven bullocks and seven rams. 
\v 30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram on 
\add every\add* altar.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went
not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward
the wilderness. 
\v 2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding \add in his
tents\add* according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him. 
\v 3 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said,
and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 
\v 4 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the
Almighty, falling \add into a trance,\add* but having his eyes open: 
\v 5 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, \add and\add* thy tabernacles, O
Israel! 
\v 6 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as
the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, \add and\add* as cedar
trees beside the waters. 
\v 7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed \add shall be
\add* in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom
shall be exalted. 
\v 8 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength of an
unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break their bones,
and pierce \add them\add* through with his arrows. 
\v 9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall stir
him up? Blessed \add is\add* he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that
curseth thee.
\p
\v 10 And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his hands
together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine enemies,
and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed \add them\add* these three times. 
\v 11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee unto
great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour. 
\v 12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers which
thou sentest unto me, saying, 
\v 13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go
beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do \add either\add* good or bad of mine
own mind; \add but\add* what the LORD saith, that will I speak? 
\v 14 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come \add therefore, and
\add* I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the
latter days.
\p
\v 15 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said,
and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 
\v 16 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of
the most High, \add which\add* saw the vision of the Almighty, falling 
\add into a trance,\add* but having his eyes open: 
\v 17 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there
shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and
shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. 
\v 18 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his
enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. 
\v 19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall destroy
him that remaineth of the city.
\p
\v 20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek 
\add was\add* the first of the nations; but his latter end \add shall be
\add* that he perish for ever. 
\v 21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong
is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. 
\v 22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry thee
away captive. 
\v 23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God
doeth this! 
\v 24 And ships \add shall come\add* from the coast of Chittim, and shall
afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever. 
\v 25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also
went his way.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom with
the daughters of Moab. 
\v 2 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and the
people did eat, and bowed down to their gods. 
\v 3 And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was
kindled against Israel. 
\v 4 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang
them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may
be turned away from Israel. 
\v 5 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that
were joined unto Baal-peor.
\p
\v 6 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought unto his
brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all
the congregation of the children of Israel, who \add were\add* weeping 
\add before\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
\v 7 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw 
\add it,\add* he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in
his hand; 
\v 8 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of
them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So the
plague was stayed from the children of Israel. 
\v 9 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.
\p
\v 10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 11 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned
my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake
among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. 
\v 12 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: 
\v 13 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, \add even\add* the
covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and
made an atonement for the children of Israel. 
\v 14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, \add even\add* that was
slain with the Midianitish woman, \add was\add* Zimri, the son of Salu, a
prince of a chief house among the Simeonites. 
\v 15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain \add was
\add* Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he \add was\add* head over a people, 
\add and\add* of a chief house in Midian.
\p
\v 16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 17 Vex the Midianites, and smite them: 
\v 18 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in
the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of
Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor’s
sake.
\c 26
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto Moses and
unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, 
\v 2 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, from
twenty years old and upward, throughout their fathers’ house, all that are
able to go to war in Israel. 
\v 3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of Moab by
Jordan \add near\add* Jericho, saying, 
\v 4 \add Take the sum of the people,\add* from twenty years old and upward;
as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which went forth out

\v 53 Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the
number of names. 
\v 54 To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou shalt give
the less inheritance: to every one shall his inheritance be given according to
those that were numbered of him.

of Sinai. 
\v 65 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness.
And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and
Joshua the son of Nun.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of
Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh
the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and
Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 
\v 2 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before
the princes and all the congregation, \add by\add* the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation, saying, 
\v 3 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them
that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah;
but died in his own sin, and had no sons. 
\v 4 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family,
because he hath no son? Give unto us \add therefore\add* a possession among
the brethren of our father. 
\v 5 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.
\p
\v 6 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 7 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a
possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren; and thou shalt
cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. 
\v 8 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die,
and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his
daughter. 
\v 9 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his
brethren. 
\v 10 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his
father’s brethren. 
\v 11 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance
unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it:
and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD
commanded Moses.
\p
\v 12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and
see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. 
\v 13 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people,
as Aaron thy brother was gathered. 
\v 14 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the
strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes:
that \add is\add* the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
\p
\v 15 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, 
\v 16 Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the
congregation, 
\v 17 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which
may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the
LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd.
\p
\v 18 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in
whom \add is\add* the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; 
\v 19 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation;
and give him a charge in their sight. 
\v 20 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. 
\v 21 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask \add counsel
\add* for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall
they go out, and at his word they shall come in, \add both\add* he, and all
the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation. 
\v 22 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him
before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: 
\v 23 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD
commanded by the hand of Moses.
\c 28
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, 
\add and\add* my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, \add for\add* a sweet
savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season. 
\v 3 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye
shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by
day, \add for\add* a continual burnt offering. 
\v 4 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt
thou offer at even; 
\v 5 And a tenth \add part\add* of an ephah of flour for a meat offering,
mingled with the fourth \add part\add* of an hin of beaten oil. 
\v 6 \add It is\add* a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount
Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD. 
\v 7 And the drink offering thereof \add shall be\add* the fourth \add part
\add* of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy \add place\add* shalt thou cause

morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer \add it,
\add* a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\p
\v 9 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two

\v 40 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that the LORD
commanded Moses.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of
Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded. 
\v 2 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with
a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that
proceedeth out of his mouth. 
\v 3 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind \add herself
\add* by a bond, \add being\add* in her father’s house in her youth; 
\v 4 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her
soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall
stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand. 
\v 5 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her
vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the
LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her. 
\v 6 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of
her lips, wherewith she bound her soul; 
\v 7 And her husband heard \add it,\add* and held his peace at her in the day
that he heard \add it:\add* then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith
she bound her soul shall stand. 
\v 8 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard \add it;
\add* then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered
with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD
shall forgive her. 
\v 9 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they
have bound their souls, shall stand against her. 
\v 10 And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond
with an oath; 
\v 11 And her husband heard \add it,\add* and held his peace at her, 
\add and\add* disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every
bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand. 
\v 12 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard 
\add them; then\add* whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows,
or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made
them void; and the LORD shall forgive her. 
\v 13 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may
establish it, or her husband may make it void. 
\v 14 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day;
then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which \add are
\add* upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the
day that he heard \add them. \add*
\v 15 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard 
\add them;\add* then he shall bear her iniquity. 
\v 16 These \add are\add* the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses,
between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, \add being
yet\add* in her youth in her father’s house.

\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be
gathered unto thy people. 
\v 3 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the
war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian. 
\v 4 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye
send to the war. 
\v 5 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of 
\add every\add* tribe, twelve thousand armed for war. 
\v 6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of \add every\add* tribe, them
and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy
instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand. 
\v 7 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and
they slew all the males. 
\v 8 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were
slain; \add namely,\add* Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five
kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. 
\v 9 And the children of Israel took \add all\add* the women of Midian
captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and
all their flocks, and all their goods. 
\v 10 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly
castles, with fire. 
\v 11 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, \add both\add* of men and
of beasts. 
\v 12 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses,
and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel,
unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which \add are\add* by Jordan \add near
\add* Jericho.
\p
\v 13 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. 
\v 14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, \add with\add* the
captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the
battle. 
\v 15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? 
\v 16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of
Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there
was a plague among the congregation of the LORD. 
\v 17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every
woman that hath known man by lying with him. 
\v 18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him,
keep alive for yourselves. 
\v 19 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any
person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify \add both\add* yourselves
and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day. 
\v 20 And purify all \add your\add* raiment, and all that is made of skins,
and all work of goats’ \add hair,\add* and all things made of wood.
\p
\v 21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the
battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses; 
\v 22 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the
lead, 
\v 23 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make \add it\add* go
through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified
with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make
go through the water. 
\v 24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be
clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
\p
\v 25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 26 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, \add both\add* of man and of
beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the
congregation: 
\v 27 And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon
them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: 
\v 28 And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went out to
battle: one soul of five hundred, \add both\add* of the persons, and of the
beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep: 
\v 29 Take \add it\add* of their half, and give \add it\add* unto Eleazar the
priest, \add for\add* an heave offering of the LORD. 
\v 30 And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one portion of
fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all
manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the
tabernacle of the LORD. 
\v 31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 32 And the booty, \add being\add* the rest of the prey which the men of war
had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand
sheep, 
\v 33 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 
\v 34 And threescore and one thousand asses, 
\v 35 And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known
man by lying with him. 
\v 36 And the half, \add which was\add* the portion of them that went out to
war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and
five hundred sheep: 
\v 37 And the LORD’S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and
fifteen. 
\v 38 And the beeves \add were\add* thirty and six thousand; of which the
LORD’S tribute \add was\add* threescore and twelve. 
\v 39 And the asses \add were\add* thirty thousand and five hundred; of which
the LORD’S tribute \add was\add* threescore and one. 
\v 40 And the persons \add were\add* sixteen thousand; of which the LORD’S
tribute \add was\add* thirty and two persons. 
\v 41 And Moses gave the tribute, \add which was\add* the LORD’S heave
offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
\v 42 And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men
that warred, 
\v 43 (Now the half \add that pertained unto\add* the congregation was three
hundred thousand and thirty thousand \add and\add* seven thousand and five
hundred sheep, 
\v 44 And thirty and six thousand beeves, 
\v 45 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 
\v 46 And sixteen thousand persons;) 
\v 47 Even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one portion of fifty,
\add both\add* of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept
the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 48 And the officers which \add were\add* over thousands of the host, the
captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses: 
\v 49 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of
war which \add are\add* under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of
us. 
\v 50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath
gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and
tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD. 
\v 51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, \add even
\add* all wrought jewels. 
\v 52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of
the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen
thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. 
\v 53 (\add For\add* the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) 
\v 54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of
thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the
congregation, \add for\add* a memorial for the children of Israel before the
LORD.
\c 32
\p
\v 1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great
multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of
Gilead, that, behold, the place \add was\add* a place for cattle; 
\v 2 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses,
and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying, 
\v 3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 
\v 4 \add Even\add* the country which the LORD smote before the congregation
of Israel, \add is\add* a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: 
\v 5 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land
be given unto thy servants for a possession, \add and\add* bring us not over
Jordan.
\p
\v 6 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben,
Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? 
\v 7 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from
going over into the land which the LORD hath given them? 
\v 8 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the
land. 
\v 9 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they
discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into
the land which the LORD had given them. 
\v 10 And the LORD’S anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying, 
\v 11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old
and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and
unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: 
\v 12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun:
for they have wholly followed the LORD. 
\v 13 And the LORD’S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander
in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in
the sight of the LORD, was consumed. 
\v 14 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of
sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel. 
\v 15 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the
wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
\p
\v 16 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for
our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 
\v 17 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel,
until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell
in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 
\v 18 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have
inherited every man his inheritance. 
\v 19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward;
because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.
\p
\v 20 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed
before the LORD to war, 
\v 21 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath
driven out his enemies from before him, 
\v 22 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return,
and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be
your possession before the LORD. 
\v 23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and
be sure your sin will find you out. 
\v 24 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do
that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. 
\v 25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses,
saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. 
\v 26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be
there in the cities of Gilead: 
\v 27 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the
LORD to battle, as my lord saith. 
\v 28 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the
son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel: 
\v 29 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the children of
Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the
LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the
land of Gilead for a possession: 
\v 30 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
possessions among you in the land of Canaan. 
\v 31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As
the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do. 
\v 32 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that
the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan \add may be\add* ours. 
\v 33 And Moses gave unto them, \add even\add* to the children of Gad, and to
the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph,
the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of
Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, \add even\add* the
cities of the country round about.
\p
\v 34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, 
\v 35 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, 
\v 36 And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fenced cities: and folds for sheep. 
\v 37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim, 
\v 38 And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and
gave other names unto the cities which they builded. 
\v 39 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took
it, and dispossessed the Amorite which \add was\add* in it. 
\v 40 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt
therein. 
\v 41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and
called them Havoth-jair. 
\v 42 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it
Nobah, after his own name.
\c 33
\p
\v 1 These \add are\add* the journeys of the children of Israel, which went
forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and
Aaron. 
\v 2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the
commandment of the LORD: and these \add are\add* their journeys according to
their goings out. 
\v 3 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day
of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel
went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. 
\v 4 For the Egyptians buried all \add their\add* firstborn, which the LORD
had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments. 
\v 5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in Succoth.
\v 6 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which \add is
\add* in the edge of the wilderness. 
\v 7 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pi-hahiroth, which 
\add is\add* before Baal- zephon: and they pitched before Migdol. 
\v 8 And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth, and passed through the midst
of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days’ journey in the wilderness
of Etham, and pitched in Marah. 
\v 9 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim \add were
\add* twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they
pitched there. 
\v 10 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea. 
\v 11 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the wilderness of
Sin. 
\v 12 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and encamped
in Dophkah. 
\v 13 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush. 
\v 14 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no
water for the people to drink. 
\v 15 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of
Sinai. 
\v 16 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
Kibroth-hattaavah. 
\v 17 And they departed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth. 
\v 18 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah. 
\v 19 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmon-parez. 
\v 20 And they departed from Rimmon-parez, and pitched in Libnah. 
\v 21 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah. 
\v 22 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah. 
\v 23 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher. 
\v 24 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah. 
\v 25 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth. 
\v 26 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath. 
\v 27 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah. 
\v 28 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah. 
\v 29 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah. 
\v 30 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth. 
\v 31 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Bene-jaakan. 
\v 32 And they removed from Bene-jaakan, and encamped at Hor-hagidgad. 
\v 33 And they went from Hor-hagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah. 
\v 34 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah. 
\v 35 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Ezion-gaber. 
\v 36 And they removed from Ezion-gaber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin,
which \add is\add* Kadesh. 
\v 37 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of
the land of Edom. 
\v 38 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the
LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were
come out of the land of Egypt, in the first \add day\add* of the fifth month.
\v 39 And Aaron \add was\add* an hundred and twenty and three years old when
he died in mount Hor. 
\v 40 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land of
Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel. 
\v 41 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah. 
\v 42 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon. 
\v 43 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth. 
\v 44 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ije-abarim, in the border
of Moab. 
\v 45 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibon-gad. 
\v 46 And they removed from Dibon-gad, and encamped in Almon-diblathaim. 
\v 47 And they removed from Almon-diblathaim, and pitched in the mountains of
Abarim, before Nebo. 
\v 48 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in the
plains of Moab by Jordan \add near\add* Jericho. 
\v 49 And they pitched by Jordan, from Beth- jesimoth \add even\add* unto
Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.
\p
\v 50 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan 
\add near\add* Jericho, saying, 
\v 51 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed
over Jordan into the land of Canaan; 
\v 52 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you,
and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite
pluck down all their high places: 
\v 53 And ye shall dispossess \add the inhabitants\add* of the land, and dwell
therein: for I have given you the land to possess it. 
\v 54 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your
families: \add and\add* to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to
the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man’s \add inheritance
\add* shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of
your fathers ye shall inherit. 
\v 55 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before
you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them 
\add shall be\add* pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall
vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. 
\v 56 Moreover it shall come to pass, \add that\add* I shall do unto you, as I
thought to do unto them.
\c 34
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the
land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance,
\add even\add* the land of Canaan with the coasts thereof:) 
\v 3 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin along by the
coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt
sea eastward: 
\v 4 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and
pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to
Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-addar, and pass on to Azmon: 
\v 5 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt,
and the goings out of it shall be at the sea. 
\v 6 And \add as for\add* the western border, ye shall even have the great sea
for a border: this shall be your west border. 
\v 7 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point
out for you mount Hor: 
\v 8 From mount Hor ye shall point out \add your border\add* unto the entrance
of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad:
\p
\v 9 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be
at Hazar- enan: this shall be your north border. 
\v 10 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham: 
\v 11 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of
Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the sea of
Chinnereth eastward: 
\v 12 And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it shall
be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round
about. 
\v 13 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This \add is
\add* the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give
unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: 
\v 14 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house of their
fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their
fathers, have received \add their inheritance;\add* and half the tribe of
Manasseh have received their inheritance: 
\v 15 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on
this side Jordan \add near\add* Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising. 
\v 16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 17 These \add are\add* the names of the men which shall divide the land
unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. 
\v 18 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by
inheritance. 
\v 19 And the names of the men \add are\add* these: Of the tribe of Judah,
Caleb the son of Jephunneh. 
\v 20 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.
\v 21 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. 
\v 22 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son of
Jogli. 
\v 23 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children of
Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod. 
\v 24 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son
of Shiphtan. 
\v 25 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the
son of Parnach. 
\v 26 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son
of Azzan. 
\v 27 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of
Shelomi. 
\v 28 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel the son
of Ammihud. 
\v 29 These \add are they\add* whom the LORD commanded to divide the
inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.
\c 35
\p
\v 1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan \add near
\add* Jericho, saying, 
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the Levites of the
inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give 
\add also\add* unto the Levites suburbs for the cities round about them. 
\v 3 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall
be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts. 
\v 4 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, 
\add shall reach\add* from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits
round about. 
\v 5 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand
cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two
thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits and the city 
\add shall be\add* in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the
cities. 
\v 6 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites \add there
shall be\add* six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the manslayer,
that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities. 
\v 7 \add So\add* all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites 
\add shall be\add* forty and eight cities: them \add shall ye give\add* with
their suburbs. 
\v 8 And the cities which ye shall give \add shall be\add* of the possession
of the children of Israel: from \add them that have\add* many ye shall give
many; but from \add them that have\add* few ye shall give few: every one shall
give of his cities unto the Levites according to his inheritance which he
inheriteth.
\p
\v 9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 
\v 10 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come
over Jordan into the land of Canaan; 
\v 11 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that
the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any person at unawares. 
\v 12 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the
manslayer die not, until he stand before the congregation in judgment. 
\v 13 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for
refuge. 
\v 14 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three cities shall
ye give in the land of Canaan, \add which\add* shall be cities of refuge. 
\v 15 These six cities shall be a refuge, \add both\add* for the children of
Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one
that killeth any person unawares may flee thither. 
\v 16 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he die, he 
\add is\add* a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
\v 17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die, and he
die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. 
\v 18 Or \add if\add* he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he
may die, and he die, he \add is\add* a murderer: the murderer shall surely be
put to death. 
\v 19 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth
him, he shall slay him. 
\v 20 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that
he die; 
\v 21 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote 
\add him\add* shall surely be put to death; \add for\add* he \add is
\add* a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he
meeteth him. 
\v 22 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast upon him any
thing without laying of wait, 
\v 23 Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing \add him\add* not,
and cast \add it\add* upon him, that he die, and \add was\add* not his enemy,
neither sought his harm: 
\v 24 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of
blood according to these judgments: 
\v 25 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the
revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his
refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the
high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil. 
\v 26 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city
of his refuge, whither he was fled; 
\v 27 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of
his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty
of blood: 
\v 28 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the
death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer
shall return into the land of his possession. 
\v 29 So these \add things\add* shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
throughout your generations in all your dwellings. 
\v 30 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the
mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person 
\add to cause him\add* to die. 
\v 31 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which
\add is\add* guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death. 
\v 32 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of
his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of
the priest. 
\v 33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye \add are:\add* for blood it
defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed
therein, but by the blood of him that shed it. 
\v 34 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell:
for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

\v 1 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son
of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came
near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the
children of Israel: 
\v 2 And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an
inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the
LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters. 
\v 3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the \add other\add* tribes
of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the
inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe
whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our
inheritance. 
\v 4 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their
inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are
received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the
tribe of our fathers. 
\v 5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the
LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. 
\v 6 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of
Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family
of the tribe of their father shall they marry. 
\v 7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe
to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the
inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. 
\v 8 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the
children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her
father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his
fathers. 
\v 9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from \add one\add* tribe to another
tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep
himself to his own inheritance. 
\v 10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad: 
\v 11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of
Zelophehad, were married unto their father’s brothers’ sons: 
\v 12 \add And\add* they were married into the families of the sons of
Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the
family of their father. 
\v 13 These \add are\add* the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of
Moab by Jordan \add near\add* Jericho.
