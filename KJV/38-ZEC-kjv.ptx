\p
\v 1 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the
LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet,
saying, 
\v 2 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers. 
\v 3 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto
me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of
hosts. 
\v 4 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried,
saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from your evil ways, and 
\add from\add* your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me,
saith the LORD. 
\v 5 Your fathers, where \add are\add* they? and the prophets, do they live
for ever? 
\v 6 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets,
did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as
the LORD of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according
to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.
\p
\v 7 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which \add is
\add* the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD
unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying, 
\v 8 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood
among the myrtle trees that \add were\add* in the bottom; and behind him 
\add were there\add* red horses, speckled, and white. 
\v 9 Then said I, O my lord, what \add are\add* these? And the angel that
talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these \add be. \add*
\v 10 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These 
\add are they\add* whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and fro through the
earth. 
\v 11 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle
trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all
the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
\p
\v 12 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long
wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against
which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? 
\v 13 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me \add with
\add* good words \add and\add* comfortable words. 
\v 14 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus
saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great
jealousy. 
\v 15 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen \add that are\add* at
ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the
affliction. 
\v 16 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies:
my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be
stretched forth upon Jerusalem. 
\v 17 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities through
prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion,
and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
\p
\v 18 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns. 
\v 19 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What \add be\add* these?
And he answered me, These \add are\add* the horns which have scattered Judah,
Israel, and Jerusalem. 
\v 20 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters. 
\v 21 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying, These 
\add are\add* the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up
his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the
Gentiles, which lifted up \add their\add* horn over the land of Judah to
scatter it.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a
measuring line in his hand. 
\v 2 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure
Jerusalem, to see what \add is\add* the breadth thereof, and what \add is
\add* the length thereof. 
\v 3 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel
went out to meet him, 
\v 4 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall
be inhabited \add as\add* towns without walls for the multitude of men and
cattle therein: 
\v 5 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and
will be the glory in the midst of her.
\p
\v 6 Ho, ho, \add come forth,\add* and flee from the land of the north, saith
the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith
the LORD. 
\v 7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest \add with\add* the daughter of
Babylon. 
\v 8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto
the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of
his eye. 
\v 9 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil
to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.
\p
\v 10 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell
in the midst of thee, saith the LORD. 
\v 11 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be
my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the
LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 
\v 12 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall
choose Jerusalem again. 
\v 13 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his
holy habitation.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the
LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him. 
\v 2 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the
LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: \add is\add* not this a brand
plucked out of the fire? 
\v 3 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.
\v 4 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take
away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused
thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of
raiment. 
\v 5 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they set a fair
mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the LORD
stood by. 
\v 6 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying, 
\v 7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou
wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep
my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by. 
\v 8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before
thee: for they \add are\add* men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth
my servant the BRANCH. 
\v 9 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone 
\add shall be\add* seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof,
saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one
day. 
\v 10 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his
neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that
is wakened out of his sleep, 
\v 2 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold
a candlestick all \add of\add* gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his
seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which \add are
\add* upon the top thereof: 
\v 3 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right \add side\add* of the bowl,
and the other upon the left \add side\add* thereof. 
\v 4 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me, saying, What 
\add are\add* these, my lord? 
\v 5 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest
thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. 
\v 6 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This \add is\add* the word of
the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my
spirit, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 7 Who \add art\add* thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel \add thou
shalt become\add* a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone \add thereof
with\add* shoutings, \add crying,\add* Grace, grace unto it. 
\v 8 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
\v 9 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands
shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me
unto you. 
\v 10 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice,
and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel \add with\add* those
seven; they \add are\add* the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through
the whole earth.
\p
\v 11 Then answered I, and said unto him, What \add are\add* these two olive
trees upon the right \add side\add* of the candlestick and upon the left 
\add side\add* thereof? 
\v 12 And I answered again, and said unto him, What \add be these\add* two
olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden \add oil
\add* out of themselves? 
\v 13 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these \add be?
\add* And I said, No, my lord. 
\v 14 Then said he, These \add are\add* the two anointed ones, that stand by
the LORD of the whole earth.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a flying
roll. 
\v 2 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying
roll; the length thereof \add is\add* twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof
ten cubits. 
\v 3 Then said he unto me, This \add is\add* the curse that goeth forth over
the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off 
\add as\add* on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall
be cut off \add as\add* on that side according to it. 
\v 4 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into
the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my
name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with
the timber thereof and the stones thereof.
\p
\v 5 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto me, Lift up
now thine eyes, and see what \add is\add* this that goeth forth. 
\v 6 And I said, What \add is\add* it? And he said, This \add is\add* an ephah
that goeth forth. He said moreover, This \add is\add* their resemblance
through all the earth. 
\v 7 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this \add is
\add* a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. 
\v 8 And he said, This \add is\add* wickedness. And he cast it into the midst
of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. 
\v 9 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two
women, and the wind \add was\add* in their wings; for they had wings like the
wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the
heaven. 
\v 10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the
ephah? 
\v 11 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it
shall be established, and set there upon her own base.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains 
\add were\add* mountains of brass. 
\v 2 In the first chariot \add were\add* red horses; and in the second chariot
black horses; 
\v 3 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grisled
and bay horses. 
\v 4 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What 
\add are\add* these, my lord? 
\v 5 And the angel answered and said unto me, These \add are\add* the four
spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all
the earth. 
\v 6 The black horses which \add are\add* therein go forth into the north
country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go forth toward
the south country. 
\v 7 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro
through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the
earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth. 
\v 8 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold, these that go
toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
\p
\v 9 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, 
\v 10 Take of \add them of\add* the captivity, \add even\add* of Heldai, of
Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the same
day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah; 
\v 11 Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set \add them
\add* upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest; 
\v 12 And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying,
Behold the man whose name \add is\add* The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of
his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD: 
\v 13 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory,
and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his
throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. 
\v 14 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to
Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD. 
\v 15 And they \add that are\add* far off shall come and build in the temple
of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.
And \add this\add* shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of
the LORD your God.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, \add that
\add* the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth \add day
\add* of the ninth month, \add even\add* in Chisleu; 
\v 2 When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and
their men, to pray before the LORD, 
\v 3 \add And\add* to speak unto the priests which \add were\add* in the house
of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth
month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?
\p
\v 4 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying, 
\v 5 Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When
ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh \add month,\add* even those
seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, \add even\add* to me? 
\v 6 And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat \add for
yourselves,\add* and drink \add for yourselves? \add*
\v 7 \add Should ye\add* not \add hear\add* the words which the LORD hath
cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity,
and the cities thereof round about her, when \add men\add* inhabited the south
and the plain?
\p
\v 8 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying, 
\v 9 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew
mercy and compassions every man to his brother: 
\v 10 And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the
poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart. 
\v 11 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stopped
their ears, that they should not hear. 
\v 12 Yea, they made their hearts \add as\add* an adamant stone, lest they
should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his
spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of
hosts. 
\v 13 Therefore it is come to pass, \add that\add* as he cried, and they would
not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts: 
\v 14 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they
knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through
nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came \add to me,\add* saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy,
and I was jealous for her with great fury. 
\v 3 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst
of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain
of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain. 
\v 4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old women dwell
in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with his staff in his hand for very
age. 
\v 5 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in
the streets thereof. 
\v 6 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes of the
remnant of this people in these days, should it also be marvellous in mine
eyes? saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people from the east
country, and from the west country; 
\v 8 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem:
and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in
righteousness.
\p
\v 9 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in
these days these words by the mouth of the prophets, which \add were
\add* in the day \add that\add* the foundation of the house of the LORD of
hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. 
\v 10 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast;
neither \add was there any\add* peace to him that went out or came in because
of the affliction: for I set all men every one against his neighbour. 
\v 11 But now I \add will\add* not \add be\add* unto the residue of this
people as in the former days, saith the LORD of hosts. 
\v 12 For the seed \add shall be\add* prosperous; the vine shall give her
fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give
their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these 
\add things. \add*
\v 13 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* as ye were a curse among the
heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save you, and ye
shall be a blessing: fear not, \add but\add* let your hands be strong. 
\v 14 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you, when your
fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of hosts, and I repented not: 
\v 15 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to
the house of Judah: fear ye not.
\p
\v 16 These \add are\add* the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the
truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your
gates: 
\v 17 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour;
and love no false oath: for all these \add are things\add* that I hate, saith
the LORD.
\p
\v 18 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying, 
\v 19 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth \add month,
\add* and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of
the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful
feasts; therefore love the truth and peace. 
\v 20 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; \add It shall\add* yet \add come to pass,
\add* that there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities: 
\v 21 And the inhabitants of one \add city\add* shall go to another, saying,
Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the LORD of hosts: I
will go also. 
\v 22 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the LORD of hosts
in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD. 
\v 23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days \add it shall come to pass,
\add* that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even
shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with
you: for we have heard \add that\add* God \add is\add* with you.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus 
\add shall be\add* the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the
tribes of Israel, \add shall be\add* toward the LORD. 
\v 2 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very
wise. 
\v 3 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the
dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets. 
\v 4 Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the
sea; and she shall be devoured with fire. 
\v 5 Ashkelon shall see \add it,\add* and fear; Gaza also \add shall see it,
\add* and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed;
and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. 
\v 6 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the
Philistines. 
\v 7 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations
from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, \add shall be
\add* for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a
Jebusite. 
\v 8 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him
that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall
pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.
\p
\v 9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:
behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he \add is\add* just, and having salvation;
lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. 
\v 10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from
Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto
the heathen: and his dominion \add shall be\add* from sea \add even
\add* to sea, and from river \add even\add* to the ends of the earth. 
\v 11 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy
prisoners out of the pit wherein \add is\add* no water.
\p
\v 12 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I
declare \add that\add* I will render double unto thee; 
\v 13 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised
up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of
a mighty man. 
\v 14 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as
the lightning: and the LORD GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with
whirlwinds of the south. 
\v 15 The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue
with sling stones; and they shall drink, \add and\add* make a noise as through
wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, \add and\add* as the corners of the
altar. 
\v 16 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his
people: for they \add shall be as\add* the stones of a crown, lifted up as an
ensign upon his land. 
\v 17 For how great \add is\add* his goodness, and how great \add is
\add* his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the
maids.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; \add so
\add* the LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain, to
every one grass in the field. 
\v 2 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and
have told false dreams; they comfort in vain: therefore they went their way as
a flock, they were troubled, because \add there was\add* no shepherd. 
\v 3 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished the goats:
for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the house of Judah, and hath made
them as his goodly horse in the battle. 
\v 4 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of him the
battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.
\p
\v 5 And they shall be as mighty \add men,\add* which tread down \add their
enemies\add* in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they shall fight,
because the LORD \add is\add* with them, and the riders on horses shall be
confounded. 
\v 6 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of
Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them:
and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I \add am\add* the
LORD their God, and will hear them. 
\v 7 And \add they of\add* Ephraim shall be like a mighty \add man,
\add* and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall
see \add it,\add* and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD. 
\v 8 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they
shall increase as they have increased. 
\v 9 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember me in far
countries; and they shall live with their children, and turn again. 
\v 10 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them
out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and
\add place\add* shall not be found for them. 
\v 11 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall smite the
waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up: and the pride
of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.
\v 12 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up and down
in his name, saith the LORD.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars. 
\v 2 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty are spoiled:
howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the vintage is come down.
\p
\v 3 \add There is\add* a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their
glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for the pride of
Jordan is spoiled. 
\v 4 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter; 
\v 5 Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty: and they that
sell them say, Blessed \add be\add* the LORD; for I am rich: and their own
shepherds pity them not. 
\v 6 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD: but,
lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the
hand of his king: and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will
not deliver \add them. \add*
\v 7 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, \add even\add* you, O poor of the
flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I
called Bands; and I fed the flock. 
\v 8 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul lothed them, and
their soul also abhorred me. 
\v 9 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that
that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the
flesh of another.
\p
\v 10 And I took my staff, \add even\add* Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I
might break my covenant which I had made with all the people. 
\v 11 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited
upon me knew that it \add was\add* the word of the LORD. 
\v 12 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give \add me\add* my price; and
if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty \add pieces\add* of
silver. 
\v 13 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that
I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty \add pieces\add* of silver, and
cast them to the potter in the house of the LORD. 
\v 14 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, \add even\add* Bands, that I might
break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
\p
\v 15 And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments of a
foolish shepherd. 
\v 16 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, \add which\add* shall
not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young one, nor heal
that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth still: but he shall eat the
flesh of the fat, and tear their claws in pieces. 
\v 17 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword \add shall
be\add* upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall be clean dried up,
and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.

\v 1 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD, which
stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and
formeth the spirit of man within him. 
\v 2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people
round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah \add and
\add* against Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people:
all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the
people of the earth be gathered together against it. 
\v 4 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with astonishment,
and his rider with madness: and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah,
and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. 
\v 5 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The inhabitants of
Jerusalem \add shall be\add* my strength in the LORD of hosts their God.
\p
\v 6 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth of fire
among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they shall devour all
the people round about, on the right hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall
be inhabited again in her own place, \add even\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 7 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the
house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify 
\add themselves\add* against Judah. 
\v 8 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he
that is feeble among them at that day shall be as David; and the house of
David \add shall be\add* as God, as the angel of the LORD before them.
\p
\v 9 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* I will seek to
destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
\v 10 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon
me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for 
\add his\add* only \add son,\add* and shall be in bitterness for him, as one
that is in bitterness for \add his\add* firstborn. 
\v 11 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the
mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon. 
\v 12 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of the house of
David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart,
and their wives apart; 
\v 13 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family
of Shimei apart, and their wives apart; 
\v 14 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives
apart.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to
the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.
\p
\v 2 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, 
\add that\add* I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they
shall no more be remembered: and also I will cause the prophets and the
unclean spirit to pass out of the land. 
\v 3 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* when any shall yet prophesy,
then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt
not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD: and his father and
his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth. 
\v 4 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the prophets shall
be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; neither shall
they wear a rough garment to deceive: 
\v 5 But he shall say, I \add am\add* no prophet, I \add am\add* an
husbandman; for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth. 
\v 6 And \add one\add* shall say unto him, What \add are\add* these wounds in
thine hands? Then he shall answer, \add Those\add* with which I was wounded 
\add in\add* the house of my friends.
\p
\v 7 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man \add that is
\add* my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep
shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. 
\v 8 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* in all the land, saith the
LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off \add and\add* die; but the third
shall be left therein. 
\v 9 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will refine them as
silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my
name, and I will hear them: I will say, It \add is\add* my people: and they
shall say, The LORD \add is\add* my God.
\c 14
\p
\v 1 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be divided in the
midst of thee. 
\v 2 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city
shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the
city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be
cut off from the city. 
\v 3 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he
fought in the day of battle.
\p
\v 4 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which 
\add is\add* before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall
cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, \add and
there shall be\add* a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove
toward the north, and half of it toward the south. 
\v 5 And ye shall flee \add to\add* the valley of the mountains; for the
valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall flee, like as ye
fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the
LORD my God shall come, \add and\add* all the saints with thee. 
\v 6 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* the light shall not
be clear, \add nor\add* dark: 
\v 7 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor
night: but it shall come to pass, \add that\add* at evening time it shall be
light. 
\v 8 And it shall be in that day, \add that\add* living waters shall go out
from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward
the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be. 
\v 9 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be
one LORD, and his name one. 
\v 10 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of
Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from
Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate, unto the corner gate, and 
\add from\add* the tower of Hananeel unto the king’s winepresses. 
\v 11 And \add men\add* shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.
\p
\v 12 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all the
people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away
while they stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their
holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. 
\v 13 And it shall come to pass in that day, \add that\add* a great tumult
from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the
hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his
neighbour. 
\v 14 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the
heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel,
in great abundance. 
\v 15 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and
of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this
plague.
\p
\v 16 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* every one that is left of all
the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to
worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
\v 17 And it shall be, \add that\add* whoso will not come up of \add all
\add* the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD
of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain. 
\v 18 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that \add have
\add* no \add rain;\add* there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will
smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
\v 19 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations
that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\p
\v 20 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO
THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD’S house shall be like the bowls before the
altar. 
\v 21 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the LORD
of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe
therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of
the LORD of hosts.
