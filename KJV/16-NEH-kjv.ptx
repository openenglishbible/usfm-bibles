\mt The Book of Nehemiah 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the
month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace, 
\v 2 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and \add certain\add* men of
Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left
of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem. 
\v 3 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there
in the province \add are\add* in great affliction and reproach: the wall of
Jerusalem also \add is\add* broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with
fire.
\p
\v 4 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept,
and mourned \add certain\add* days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of
heaven, 
\v 5 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible
God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his
commandments: 
\v 6 Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest
hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night,
for the children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children
of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father’s house
have sinned. 
\v 7 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the
commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou commandedst thy
servant Moses. 
\v 8 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant
Moses, saying, \add If\add* ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the
nations: 
\v 9 But \add if\add* ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them;
though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, 
\add yet\add* will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the
place that I have chosen to set my name there. 
\v 10 Now these \add are\add* thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand. 
\v 11 O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of
thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire to fear thy name:
and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the
sight of this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer.

\v 1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of
Artaxerxes the king, \add that\add* wine \add was\add* before him: and I took
up the wine, and gave \add it\add* unto the king. Now I had not been 
\add beforetime\add* sad in his presence. 
\v 2 Wherefore the king said unto me, Why \add is\add* thy countenance sad,
seeing thou \add art\add* not sick? this \add is\add* nothing \add else
\add* but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid, 
\v 3 And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my
countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, 
\add lieth\add* waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire? 
\v 4 Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed
to the God of heaven. 
\v 5 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have
found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the
city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build it. 
\v 6 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long
shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to
send me; and I set him a time. 
\v 7 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be
given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till
I come into Judah; 
\v 8 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give
me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which \add appertained
\add* to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I
shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my
God upon me.
\p
\v 9 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the king’s
letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me. 
\v 10 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard
\add of it,\add* it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek
the welfare of the children of Israel. 
\v 11 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
\p
\v 12 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I 
\add any\add* man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem: neither
\add was there any\add* beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon. 
\v 13 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the
dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which
were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. 
\v 14 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s pool: but
\add there was\add* no place for the beast \add that was\add* under me to
pass. 
\v 15 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall, and
turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and \add so\add*
returned. 
\v 16 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as
yet told \add it\add* to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor
to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.
\p
\v 17 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we \add are\add* in, how
Jerusalem \add lieth\add* waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire:
come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a
reproach. 
\v 18 Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as also
the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and
build. So they strengthened their hands for \add this\add* good \add work. 
\add*
\v 19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite,
and Geshem the Arabian, heard \add it,\add* they laughed us to scorn, and
despised us, and said, What \add is\add* this thing that ye do? will ye rebel
against the king? 
\v 20 Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will
prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no
portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.

\p
\v 1 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and
they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it;

thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate. 
\v 14 But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler of part
of Beth-haccerem; he build it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks
thereof, and the bars thereof. 
\v 15 But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Col-hozeh, the
ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors
thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of
Siloah by the king’s garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the city of
David. 
\v 16 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part

\v 20 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece,
from the turning \add of the wall\add* unto the door of the house of Eliashib
the high priest. 
\v 21 After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another

\add* and the tower which lieth out from the king’s high house, that 
\add was\add* by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of
Parosh. 
\v 26 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto \add the place\add* over

\v 32 And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the
goldsmiths and the merchants.

\p
\v 1 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the wall,
he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews. 
\v 2 And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What
do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will
they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the
rubbish which are burned? 
\v 3 Now Tobiah the Ammonite \add was\add* by him, and he said, Even that
which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall. 
\v 4 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon their
own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: 
\v 5 And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from
before thee: for they have provoked \add thee\add* to anger before the
builders. 
\v 6 So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto the half
thereof: for the people had a mind to work.
\p
\v 7 But it came to pass, \add that\add* when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of
Jerusalem were made up, \add and\add* that the breaches began to be stopped,
then they were very wroth, 
\v 8 And conspired all of them together to come \add and\add* to fight against
Jerusalem, and to hinder it. 
\v 9 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against
them day and night, because of them. 
\v 10 And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and 
\add there is\add* much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall. 
\v 11 And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come
in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease. 
\v 12 And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came, they
said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return unto us 
\add they will be upon you.\add*
\p
\v 13 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, \add and
\add* on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with
their swords, their spears, and their bows. 
\v 14 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers,
and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, 
\add which is\add* great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons,
and your daughters, your wives, and your houses. 
\v 15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us,
and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the
wall, every one unto his work. 
\v 16 And it came to pass from that time forth, \add that\add* the half of my
servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears,
the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers \add were
\add* behind all the house of Judah. 
\v 17 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with those
that laded, \add every one\add* with one of his hands wrought in the work, and
with the other \add hand\add* held a weapon. 
\v 18 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and 
\add so\add* builded. And he that sounded the trumpet \add was\add* by me.
\p
\v 19 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the
people, The work \add is\add* great and large, and we are separated upon the
wall, one far from another. 
\v 20 In what place \add therefore\add* ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us. 
\v 21 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from the
rising of the morning till the stars appeared. 
\v 22 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his
servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us,
and labour on the day. 
\v 23 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard
which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, \add saving that
\add* every one put them off for washing.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their
brethren the Jews. 
\v 2 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, \add are
\add* many: therefore we take up corn \add for them,\add* that we may eat, and
live. 
\v 3 \add Some\add* also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth. 
\v 4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute,
\add and that upon\add* our lands and vineyards. 
\v 5 Yet now our flesh \add is\add* as the flesh of our brethren, our children
as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters
to be servants, and \add some\add* of our daughters are brought unto bondage 
\add already:\add* neither \add is it\add* in our power \add to redeem them;
\add* for other men have our lands and vineyards.
\p
\v 6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 
\v 7 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the rulers,
and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I set a
great assembly against them. 
\v 8 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the
Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even sell your brethren?
or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing 
\add to answer. \add*
\v 9 Also I said, It \add is\add* not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in
the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies? 
\v 10 I likewise, \add and\add* my brethren, and my servants, might exact of
them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury. 
\v 11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their
vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the the hundredth 
\add part\add* of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye
exact of them. 
\v 12 Then said they, We will restore \add them,\add* and will require nothing
of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an
oath of them, that they should do according to this promise. 
\v 13 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his
house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even thus be he
shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the
LORD. And the people did according to this promise.
\p
\v 14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the
land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of
Artaxerxes the king, \add that is,\add* twelve years, I and my brethren have
not eaten the bread of the governor. 
\v 15 But the former governors that \add had been\add* before me were
chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty
shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so
did not I, because of the fear of God. 
\v 16 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any
land: and all my servants \add were\add* gathered thither unto the work. 
\v 17 Moreover \add there were\add* at my table an hundred and fifty of the
Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that 
\add are\add* about us. 
\v 18 Now \add that\add* which was prepared \add for me\add* daily \add was
\add* one ox \add and\add* six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me,
and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not
I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people. 
\v 19 Think upon me, my God, for good, \add according\add* to all that I have
done for this people.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the Arabian,
and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the wall, and 
\add that\add* there was no breach left therein; (though at that time I had
not set up the doors upon the gates;) 
\v 2 That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet
together in \add some one of\add* the villages in the plain of Ono. But they
thought to do me mischief. 
\v 3 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I \add am\add* doing a great
work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave
it, and come down to you? 
\v 4 Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them
after the same manner. 
\v 5 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time
with an open letter in his hand; 
\v 6 Wherein \add was\add* written, It is reported among the heathen, and
Gashmu saith \add it, that\add* thou and the Jews think to rebel: for which
cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their king, according to
these words. 
\v 7 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem,
saying, \add There is\add* a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to
the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel
together. 
\v 8 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou
sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart. 
\v 9 For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from
the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, \add O God,\add* strengthen my
hands. 
\v 10 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son
of Mehetabeel, who \add was\add* shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in
the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple:
for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay
thee. 
\v 11 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who \add is there,
\add* that, \add being\add* as I \add am,\add* would go into the temple to
save his life? I will not go in. 
\v 12 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced
this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. 
\v 13 Therefore \add was\add* he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so,
and sin, and \add that\add* they might have \add matter\add* for an evil
report, that they might reproach me. 
\v 14 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their
works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would
have put me in fear.
\p
\v 15 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth \add day\add* of 
\add the month\add* Elul, in fifty and two days. 
\v 16 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard \add thereof,
\add* and all the heathen that \add were\add* about us saw \add these things,
\add* they were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this
work was wrought of our God.
\p
\v 17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto
Tobiah, and \add the letters\add* of Tobiah came unto them. 
\v 18 For \add there were\add* many in Judah sworn unto him, because he 
\add was\add* the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son
Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah. 
\v 19 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to
him. \add And\add* Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors,
and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 
\v 2 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace,
charge over Jerusalem: for he \add was\add* a faithful man, and feared God
above many. 
\v 3 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the
sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar 
\add them:\add* and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one
in his watch, and every one \add to be\add* over against his house. 
\v 4 Now the city \add was\add* large and great: but the people \add were
\add* few therein, and the houses \add were\add* not builded.
\p
\v 5 And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the
rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found
a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found
written therein, 
\v 6 These \add are\add* the children of the province, that went up out of the
captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king
of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every
one unto his city; 
\v 7 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani,
Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, \add I say,
\add* of the men of the people of Israel \add was this; \add*

and three. 
\v 30 The men of Ramah and Gaba, six hundred twenty and one. 
\v 31 The men of Michmas, an hundred and twenty and two. 
\v 32 The men of Bethel and Ai, an hundred twenty and three. 
\v 33 The men of the other Nebo, fifty and two.

\v 36 The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five. 
\v 37 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one. 
\v 38 The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty.
\p
\v 39 The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine
hundred seventy and three.

\v 48 The children of Lebana, the children of Hagaba, the children of

\v 58 The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel, 
\v 59 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of
Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon. 
\v 60 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon’s servants, \add were
\add* three hundred ninety and two. 
\v 61 And these \add were\add* they which went up \add also\add* from
Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their
father’s house, nor their seed, whether they \add were\add* of Israel. 
\v 62 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda,
six hundred forty and two.
\p
\v 63 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the
children of Barzillai, which took \add one\add* of the daughters of Barzillai
the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name. 
\v 64 These sought their register \add among\add* those that were reckoned by
genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from
the priesthood. 
\v 65 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most
holy things, till there stood \add up\add* a priest with Urim and Thummim.
\p
\v 66 The whole congregation together \add was\add* forty and two thousand
three hundred and threescore, 
\v 67 Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom \add there
were\add* seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two
hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. 
\v 68 Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred
forty and five: 
\v 69 \add Their\add* camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven
hundred and twenty asses.
\p
\v 70 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha
gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and
thirty priests’ garments. 
\v 71 And \add some\add* of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of
the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred
pounds of silver. 
\v 72 And \add that\add* which the rest of the people gave \add was
\add* twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and
threescore and seven priests’ garments. 
\v 73 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and 
\add some\add* of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in
their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel 
\add were\add* in their cities.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the
street that \add was\add* before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the
scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to
Israel. 
\v 2 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men
and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of
the seventh month. 
\v 3 And he read therein before the street that \add was\add* before the water
gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those
that could understand; and the ears of all the people \add were attentive
\add* unto the book of the law. 
\v 4 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for
the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and
Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand,
Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, 
\add and\add* Meshullam. 
\v 5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was
above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up: 
\v 6 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered,
Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and
worshipped the LORD with \add their\add* faces to the ground. 
\v 7 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah,
Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused
the people to understand the law: and the people \add stood\add* in their
place. 
\v 8 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave the
sense, and caused \add them\add* to understand the reading.
\p
\v 9 And Nehemiah, which \add is\add* the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This
day \add is\add* holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the
people wept, when they heard the words of the law. 
\v 10 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet,
and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for \add this
\add* day \add is\add* holy unto our Lord: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of
the LORD is your strength. 
\v 11 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the
day \add is\add* holy; neither be ye grieved. 
\v 12 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send
portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that
were declared unto them.
\p
\v 13 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of
all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to
understand the words of the law. 
\v 14 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses,
that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh
month: 
\v 15 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in
Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine
branches, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees,
to make booths, as \add it is\add* written.
\p
\v 16 So the people went forth, and brought \add them,\add* and made
themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts,
and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate,
and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. 
\v 17 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the
captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua
the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there
was very great gladness. 
\v 18 Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the
book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth
day \add was\add* a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel
were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them. 
\v 2 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood
and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. 
\v 3 And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the
LORD their God \add one\add* fourth part of the day; and \add another
\add* fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.
\p
\v 4 Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel,
Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, \add and\add* Chenani, and cried with a
loud voice unto the LORD their God. 
\v 5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah,
Hodijah, Shebaniah, \add and\add* Pethahiah, said, Stand up \add and
\add* bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious
name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise. 
\v 6 Thou, \add even\add* thou, \add art\add* LORD alone; thou hast made
heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all 
\add things\add* that \add are\add* therein, the seas, and all that 
\add is\add* therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven
worshippeth thee. 
\v 7 Thou \add art\add* the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and
broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of
Abraham; 
\v 8 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with
him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the
Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give \add it, I say,
\add* to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou \add art\add*
righteous: 
\v 9 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their
cry by the Red sea; 
\v 10 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants,
and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly
against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as \add it is\add* this day. 
\v 11 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the
midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the
deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters. 
\v 12 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the
night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should
go. 
\v 13 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from
heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and
commandments: 
\v 14 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them
precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant: 
\v 15 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth
water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they
should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them. 
\v 16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and
hearkened not to thy commandments, 
\v 17 And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst
among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a
captain to return to their bondage: but thou \add art\add* a God ready to
pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and
forsookest them not. 
\v 18 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This \add is
\add* thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great
provocations; 
\v 19 Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness:
the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the
way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way
wherein they should go. 
\v 20 Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not
thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst. 
\v 21 Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, \add so
that\add* they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet
swelled not. 
\v 22 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them
into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of
Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan. 
\v 23 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and
broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their
fathers, that they should go in to possess \add it. \add*
\v 24 So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst
before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into
their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do
with them as they would. 
\v 25 And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full
of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in
abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted
themselves in thy great goodness. 
\v 26 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast
thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them
to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations. 
\v 27 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who
vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou
heardest \add them\add* from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies
thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies. 
\v 28 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore
leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion
over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest 
\add them\add* from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according
to thy mercies; 
\v 29 And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto
thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but
sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and
withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear. 
\v 30 Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by
thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou
them into the hand of the people of the lands. 
\v 31 Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly consume
them, nor forsake them; for thou \add art\add* a gracious and merciful God. 
\v 32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who
keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee,
that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and
on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of
the kings of Assyria unto this day. 
\v 33 Howbeit thou \add art\add* just in all that is brought upon us; for thou
hast done right, but we have done wickedly: 
\v 34 Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept
thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith
thou didst testify against them. 
\v 35 For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great
goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou
gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works. 
\v 36 Behold, we \add are\add* servants this day, and \add for\add* the land
that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good
thereof, behold, we \add are\add* servants in it: 
\v 37 And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us
because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our
cattle, at their pleasure, and we \add are\add* in great distress. 
\v 38 And because of all this we make a sure \add covenant,\add* and write 
\add it;\add* and our princes, Levites, \add and\add* priests, seal 
\add unto it.\add*
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now those that sealed \add were,\add* Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of
Hachaliah, and Zidkijah, 
\v 2 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

\v 25 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah, 
\v 26 And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan, 
\v 27 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
\p
\v 28 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the
singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had separated themselves from the
people of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their
daughters, every one having knowledge, and having understanding; 
\v 29 They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a curse,
and into an oath, to walk in God’s law, which was given by Moses the servant
of God, and to observe and do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and
his judgments and his statutes; 
\v 30 And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land,
nor take their daughters for our sons: 
\v 31 And \add if\add* the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on
the sabbath day to sell, \add that\add* we would not buy it of them on the
sabbath, or on the holy day: and \add that\add* we would leave the seventh
year, and the exaction of every debt. 
\v 32 Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the
third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God; 
\v 33 For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and for the
continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new moons, for the set
feasts, and for the holy \add things,\add* and for the sin offerings to make
an atonement for Israel, and \add for\add* all the work of the house of our
God. 
\v 34 And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for
the wood offering, to bring \add it\add* into the house of our God, after the
houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar
of the LORD our God, as \add it is\add* written in the law: 
\v 35 And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the firstfruits of all
fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the house of the LORD: 
\v 36 Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as \add it is
\add* written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our flocks,
to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house
of our God: 
\v 37 And \add that\add* we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, unto the
priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground
unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the
cities of our tillage. 
\v 38 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites, when the
Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes
unto the house of our God, to the chambers, into the treasure house. 
\v 39 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall bring the
offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil, unto the chambers, where 
\add are\add* the vessels of the sanctuary, and the priests that minister, and
the porters, and the singers: and we will not forsake the house of our God.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of the people
also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and
nine parts \add to dwell\add* in \add other\add* cities. 
\v 2 And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselves to
dwell at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 Now these \add are\add* the chief of the province that dwelt in

\v 9 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, \add were\add* over against them
in the watches.
\p
\v 10 And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and Eliashib
begat Joiada, 
\v 11 And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua. 
\v 12 And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the fathers: of
Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 
\v 13 Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
\v 14 Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 
\v 15 Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 
\v 16 Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
\v 17 Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai; 
\v 18 Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
\v 19 And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
\v 20 Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 
\v 21 Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.
\p
\v 22 The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and Jaddua, 
\add were\add* recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests, to the reign
of Darius the Persian. 
\v 23 The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, \add were\add* written in
the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the son of
Eliashib. 
\v 24 And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua the son
of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to praise \add and
\add* to give thanks, according to the commandment of David the man of God,
ward over against ward. 
\v 25 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, \add were
\add* porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates. 
\v 26 These \add were\add* in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son
of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of Ezra the priest,
the scribe.
\p
\v 27 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites
out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication
with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, \add with
\add* cymbals, psalteries, and with harps. 
\v 28 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of
the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of Netophathi;
\v 29 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and
Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem. 
\v 30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the
people, and the gates, and the wall. 
\v 31 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two
great \add companies of them that gave\add* thanks, \add whereof one
\add* went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate: 
\v 32 And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, 
\v 33 And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, 
\v 34 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah, 
\v 35 And \add certain\add* of the priests’ sons with trumpets; \add namely,
\add* Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of
Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph: 
\v 36 And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,
Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of
God, and Ezra the scribe before them. 
\v 37 And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by
the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house
of David, even unto the water gate eastward. 
\v 38 And the other \add company of them that gave\add* thanks went over
against \add them,\add* and I after them, and the half of the people upon the
wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall; 
\v 39 And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above
the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the
sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate. 
\v 40 So stood the two \add companies of them that gave\add* thanks in the
house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: 
\v 41 And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai,
Zechariah, \add and\add* Hananiah, with trumpets; 
\v 42 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and
Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah 
\add their\add* overseer. 
\v 43 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for God had
made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the children rejoiced: so
that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
\p
\v 44 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to
gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of the law for
the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the
Levites that waited. 
\v 45 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God, and the
ward of the purification, according to the commandment of David, \add and
\add* of Solomon his son. 
\v 46 For in the days of David and Asaph of old \add there were\add* chief of
the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God. 
\v 47 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah,
gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and
they sanctified \add holy things\add* unto the Levites; and the Levites
sanctified \add them\add* unto the children of Aaron.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people;
and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not
come into the congregation of God for ever; 
\v 2 Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water,
but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our God
turned the curse into a blessing. 
\v 3 Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated
from Israel all the mixed multitude.
\p
\v 4 And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber
of the house of our God, \add was\add* allied unto Tobiah: 
\v 5 And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid
the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the
corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded \add to be given
\add* to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of
the priests. 
\v 6 But in all this \add time\add* was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and after
certain days obtained I leave of the king: 
\v 7 And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for
Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God. 
\v 8 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of
Tobiah out of the chamber. 
\v 9 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I
again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the
frankincense.
\p
\v 10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given 
\add them:\add* for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled
every one to his field. 
\v 11 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God
forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place. 
\v 12 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the
oil unto the treasuries. 
\v 13 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and
Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them \add was
\add* Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted
faithful, and their office \add was\add* to distribute unto their brethren. 
\v 14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds
that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices thereof.
\p
\v 15 In those days saw I in Judah \add some\add* treading winepresses on the
sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine, grapes, and
figs, and all \add manner of\add* burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem
on the sabbath day: and I testified \add against them\add* in the day wherein
they sold victuals. 
\v 16 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner
of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in
Jerusalem. 
\v 17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil
thing \add is\add* this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? 
\v 18 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon
us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the
sabbath. 
\v 19 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark
before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut, and charged
that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and \add some
\add* of my servants set I at the gates, \add that\add* there should no burden
be brought in on the sabbath day. 
\v 20 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without
Jerusalem once or twice. 
\v 21 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about
the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth
came they no \add more\add* on the sabbath. 
\v 22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves, and 
\add that\add* they should come \add and\add* keep the gates, to sanctify the
sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, \add concerning\add* this also, and spare
me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
\p
\v 23 In those days also saw I Jews \add that\add* had married wives of
Ashdod, of Ammon, \add and\add* of Moab: 
\v 24 And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not
speak in the Jews’ language, but according to the language of each people. 
\v 25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them,
and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, \add saying,
\add* Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their
daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves. 
\v 26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many
nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made
him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to
sin. 
\v 27 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress
against our God in marrying strange wives? 
\v 28 And \add one\add* of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high
priest, \add was\add* son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased
him from me. 
\v 29 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and
the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites. 
\v 30 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards of the
priests and the Levites, every one in his business; 
\v 31 And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits.
Remember me, O my God, for good.
