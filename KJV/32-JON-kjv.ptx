\mt Jonah 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, 
\v 2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their
wickedness is come up before me. 
\v 3 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD,
and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the
fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the
presence of the LORD.
\p
\v 4 But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty
tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken. 
\v 5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast
forth the wares that \add were\add* in the ship into the sea, to lighten 
\add it\add* of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and
he lay, and was fast asleep. 
\v 6 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O
sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that
we perish not. 
\v 7 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that
we may know for whose cause this evil \add is\add* upon us. So they cast lots,
and the lot fell upon Jonah. 
\v 8 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil
\add is\add* upon us; What \add is\add* thine occupation? and whence comest
thou? what \add is\add* thy country? and of what people \add art\add* thou? 
\v 9 And he said unto them, I \add am\add* an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD, the
God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry \add land. \add*
\v 10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou
done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the LORD,
because he had told them.
\p
\v 11 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be
calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous. 
\v 12 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so
shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest
\add is\add* upon you. 
\v 13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring \add it\add* to the land; but
they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them. 
\v 14 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee, O LORD,
we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us
innocent blood: for thou, O LORD, hast done as it pleased thee. 
\v 15 So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea
ceased from her raging. 
\v 16 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto
the LORD, and made vows.
\p
\v 17 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah
was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly, 
\v 2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he
heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, \add and\add* thou heardest my
voice. 
\v 3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the
floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me. 
\v 4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy
holy temple. 
\v 5 The waters compassed me about, \add even\add* to the soul: the depth
closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head. 
\v 6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars 
\add was\add* about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from
corruption, O LORD my God. 
\v 7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came
in unto thee, into thine holy temple. 
\v 8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. 
\v 9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay
\add that\add* that I have vowed. Salvation \add is\add* of the LORD.
\p
\v 10 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry
\add land.\add*
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying, 
\v 2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching
that I bid thee. 
\v 3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD.
Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days’ journey. 
\v 4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and
said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.
\p
\v 5 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on
sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. 
\v 6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and
he laid his robe from him, and covered \add him\add* with sackcloth, and sat
in ashes. 
\v 7 And he caused \add it\add* to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh
by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast,
herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: 
\v 8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto
God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence
that \add is\add* in their hands. 
\v 9 Who can tell \add if\add* God will turn and repent, and turn away from
his fierce anger, that we perish not?
\p
\v 10 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God
repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did
\add it\add* not.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. 
\v 2 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, \add was
\add* not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled
before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou \add art\add* a gracious God, and
merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the
evil. 
\v 3 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for 
\add it is\add* better for me to die than to live.
\p
\v 4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry? 
\v 5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and
there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what
would become of the city. 
\v 6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made \add it\add* to come up over
Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief.
So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. 
\v 7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote
the gourd that it withered. 
\v 8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement
east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and
wished in himself to die, and said, \add It is\add* better for me to die than
to live. 
\v 9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he
said, I do well to be angry, \add even\add* unto death. 
\v 10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou
hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and
perished in a night: 
\v 11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than
sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and
their left hand; and \add also\add* much cattle?
