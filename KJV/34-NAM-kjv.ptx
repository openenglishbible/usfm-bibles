\mt Nahum 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. 
\v 2 God \add is\add* jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth, and
\add is\add* furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he
reserveth \add wrath\add* for his enemies. 
\v 3 The LORD \add is\add* slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at
all acquit \add the wicked:\add* the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind and in
the storm, and the clouds \add are\add* the dust of his feet. 
\v 4 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers:
Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languisheth. 
\v 5 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned
at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein. 
\v 6 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness
of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down
by him. 
\v 7 The LORD \add is\add* good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
knoweth them that trust in him. 
\v 8 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place
thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. 
\v 9 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter end:
affliction shall not rise up the second time. 
\v 10 For while \add they be\add* folden together \add as\add* thorns, and
while they are drunken \add as\add* drunkards, they shall be devoured as
stubble fully dry. 
\v 11 There is \add one\add* come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the
LORD, a wicked counsellor. 
\v 12 Thus saith the LORD: Though \add they be\add* quiet, and likewise many,
yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through. Though I have
afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more. 
\v 13 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in
sunder. 
\v 14 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, \add that
\add* no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off
the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy grave; for thou art
vile. 
\v 15 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings,
that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for
the wicked shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the munition,
watch the way, make \add thy\add* loins strong, fortify \add thy\add* power
mightily. 
\v 2 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency
of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine
branches. 
\v 3 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men \add are
\add* in scarlet: the chariots \add shall be\add* with flaming torches in the
day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken. 
\v 4 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against
another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like
the lightnings. 
\v 5 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they
shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defence shall be prepared. 
\v 6 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be
dissolved. 
\v 7 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her
maids shall lead \add her\add* as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their
breasts. 
\v 8 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away.
Stand, stand, \add shall they cry;\add* but none shall look back. 
\v 9 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for \add there is
\add* none end of the store \add and\add* glory out of all the pleasant
furniture. 
\v 10 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and the knees
smite together, and much pain \add is\add* in all loins, and the faces of them
all gather blackness. 
\v 11 Where \add is\add* the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of
the young lions, where the lion, \add even\add* the old lion, walked, 
\add and\add* the lion’s whelp, and none made \add them\add* afraid? 
\v 12 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his
lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin. 
\v 13 Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will
burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions:
and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers
shall no more be heard.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies \add and\add* robbery; the
prey departeth not; 
\v 2 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the wheels, and of
the pransing horses, and of the jumping chariots. 
\v 3 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear:
and \add there is\add* a multitude of slain, and a great number of carcases;
and \add there is\add* none end of \add their\add* corpses; they stumble upon
their corpses: 
\v 4 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot, the
mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and
families through her witchcrafts. 
\v 5 Behold, I \add am\add* against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will
discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations thy nakedness,
and the kingdoms thy shame. 
\v 6 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will
set thee as a gazingstock. 
\v 7 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* all they that look upon thee
shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her?
whence shall I seek comforters for thee? 
\v 8 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the rivers, 
\add that had\add* the waters round about it, whose rampart \add was
\add* the sea, \add and\add* her wall \add was\add* from the sea? 
\v 9 Ethiopia and Egypt \add were\add* her strength, and \add it was
\add* infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers. 
\v 10 Yet \add was\add* she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they
cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.
\v 11 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt seek
strength because of the enemy. 
\v 12 All thy strong holds \add shall be like\add* fig trees with the
firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into the mouth of the
eater. 
\v 13 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee \add are\add* women: the gates
of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire shall devour
thy bars. 
\v 14 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay,
and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln. 
\v 15 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall
eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make
thyself many as the locusts. 
\v 16 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the
cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away. 
\v 17 Thy crowned \add are\add* as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, \add but\add* when the
sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they 
\add are. \add*
\v 18 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall dwell 
\add in the dust:\add* thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man
gathereth \add them. \add*
\v 19 \add There is\add* no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all
that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath
not thy wickedness passed continually?
