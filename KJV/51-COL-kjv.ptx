\mt The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Colossians 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus 
\add our\add* brother, 
\v 2 To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace
\add be\add* unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus
Christ. 
\v 3 We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying
always for you, 
\v 4 Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love \add which
ye have\add* to all the saints, 
\v 5 For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before
in the word of the truth of the gospel; 
\v 6 Which is come unto you, as \add it is\add* in all the world; and bringeth
forth fruit, as \add it doth\add* also in you, since the day ye heard 
\add of it,\add* and knew the grace of God in truth: 
\v 7 As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a
faithful minister of Christ; 
\v 8 Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit. 
\v 9 For this cause we also, since the day we heard \add it,\add* do not cease
to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of
his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; 
\v 10 That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful
in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God; 
\v 11 Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all
patience and longsuffering with joyfulness; 
\v 12 Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers
of the inheritance of the saints in light: 
\v 13 Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated 
\add us\add* into the kingdom of his dear Son: 
\v 14 In whom we have redemption through his blood, \add even\add* the
forgiveness of sins: 
\v 15 Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:
\v 16 For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in
earth, visible and invisible, whether \add they be\add* thrones, or dominions,
or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: 
\v 17 And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. 
\v 18 And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the
firstborn from the dead; that in all \add things\add* he might have the
preeminence. 
\v 19 For it pleased \add the Father\add* that in him should all fulness
dwell; 
\v 20 And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
reconcile all things unto himself; by him, \add I say,\add* whether 
\add they be\add* things in earth, or things in heaven. 
\v 21 And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in \add your
\add* mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled 
\v 22 In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and
unblameable and unreproveable in his sight: 
\v 23 If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and \add be
\add* not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, 
\add and\add* which was preached to every creature which is under heaven;
whereof I Paul am made a minister; 
\v 24 Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is
behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is
the church: 
\v 25 Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which
is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God; 
\v 26 \add Even\add* the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from
generations, but now is made manifest to his saints: 
\v 27 To whom God would make known what \add is\add* the riches of the glory
of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of
glory: 
\v 28 Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom;
that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: 
\v 29 Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which
worketh in me mightily.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and 
\add for\add* them at Laodicea, and \add for\add* as many as have not seen my
face in the flesh; 
\v 2 That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and
unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement
of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; 
\v 3 In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge. 
\v 4 And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words. 
\v 5 For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit,
joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in
Christ.
\p
\v 6 As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, \add so\add* walk ye
in him: 
\v 7 Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been
taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving. 
\v 8 Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after
the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.
\v 9 For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily. 
\v 10 And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and
power: 
\v 11 In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without
hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of
Christ: 
\v 12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with \add him
\add* through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the
dead. 
\v 13 And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; 
\v 14 Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which
was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross; 
\v 15 \add And\add* having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew
of them openly, triumphing over them in it. 
\v 16 Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an
holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath \add days: \add*
\v 17 Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body \add is\add* of
Christ. 
\v 18 Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and
worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen,
vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind, 
\v 19 And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands
having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase
of God.
\p
\v 20 Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world,
why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances, 
\v 21 (Touch not; taste not; handle not; 
\v 22 Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and
doctrines of men? 
\v 23 Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility,
and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where
Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. 
\v 2 Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth. 
\v 3 For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 
\v 4 When Christ, \add who is\add* our life, shall appear, then shall ye also
appear with him in glory.
\p
\v 5 Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication,
uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which
is idolatry: 
\v 6 For which things’ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of
disobedience: 
\v 7 In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them. 
\v 8 But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy,
filthy communication out of your mouth. 
\v 9 Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his
deeds; 
\v 10 And have put on the new \add man,\add* which is renewed in knowledge
after the image of him that created him: 
\v 11 Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision,
Barbarian, Scythian, bond \add nor\add* free: but Christ \add is\add* all, and
in all. 
\v 12 Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of
mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; 
\v 13 Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a
quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also \add do\add* ye. 
\v 14 And above all these things \add put on\add* charity, which is the bond
of perfectness. 
\v 15 And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are
called in one body; and be ye thankful. 
\v 16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and
admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with
grace in your hearts to the Lord. 
\v 17 And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, \add do\add* all in the name of
the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.
\p
\v 18 Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the
Lord. 
\v 19 Husbands, love \add your\add* wives, and be not bitter against them. 
\v 20 Children, obey \add your\add* parents in all things: for this is well
pleasing unto the Lord. 
\v 21 Fathers, provoke not your children \add to anger,\add* lest they be
discouraged. 
\v 22 Servants, obey in all things \add your\add* masters according to the
flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart,
fearing God: 
\v 23 And whatsoever ye do, do \add it\add* heartily, as to the Lord, and not
unto men; 
\v 24 Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance:
for ye serve the Lord Christ. 
\v 25 But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done:
and there is no respect of persons.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Masters, give unto \add your\add* servants that which is just and equal;
knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
\p
\v 2 Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving; 
\v 3 Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of
utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds: 
\v 4 That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak. 
\v 5 Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time. 
\v 6 Let your speech \add be\add* alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that
ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.
\p
\v 7 All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, \add who is\add* a beloved
brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: 
\v 8 Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your
estate, and comfort your hearts; 
\v 9 With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is \add one
\add* of you. They shall make known unto you all things which \add are done
\add* here.
\p
\v 10 Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister’s son to
Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you,
receive him;) 
\v 11 And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These
only \add are my\add* fellow workers unto the kingdom of God, which have been
a comfort unto me. 
\v 12 Epaphras, who is \add one\add* of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth
you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect
and complete in all the will of God. 
\v 13 For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them 
\add that are\add* in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis. 
\v 14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you. 
\v 15 Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church
which is in his house. 
\v 16 And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in
the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the \add epistle
\add* from Laodicea. 
\v 17 And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received
in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.
\p
\v 18 The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace 
\add be\add* with you. Amen.
