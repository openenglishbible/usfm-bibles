\h 2 Corinthians
\mt The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Corinthians 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy 
\add our\add* brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all
the saints which are in all Achaia: 
\v 2 Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and \add from\add* the
Lord Jesus Christ. 
\v 3 Blessed \add be\add* God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; 
\v 4 Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort
them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are
comforted of God. 
\v 5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also
aboundeth by Christ. 
\v 6 And whether we be afflicted, \add it is\add* for your consolation and
salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we
also suffer: or whether we be comforted, \add it is\add* for your consolation
and salvation. 
\v 7 And our hope of you \add is\add* stedfast, knowing, that as ye are
partakers of the sufferings, so \add shall ye be\add* also of the
consolation. 
\v 8 For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came
to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch
that we despaired even of life: 
\v 9 But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust
in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: 
\v 10 Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we
trust that he will yet deliver \add us; \add*
\v 11 Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift \add bestowed
\add* upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our
behalf.
\p
\v 12 For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in
simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of
God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to
you-ward. 
\v 13 For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or
acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end; 
\v 14 As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing,
even as ye also \add are\add* ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 15 And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye
might have a second benefit; 
\v 16 And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia
unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea. 
\v 17 When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things
that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should
be yea yea, and nay nay? 
\v 18 But \add as\add* God \add is\add* true, our word toward you was not yea
and nay. 
\v 19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, 
\add even\add* by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in
him was yea. 
\v 20 For all the promises of God in him \add are\add* yea, and in him Amen,
unto the glory of God by us. 
\v 21 Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, 
\add is\add* God; 
\v 22 Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our
hearts. 
\v 23 Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came
not as yet unto Corinth. 
\v 24 Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your
joy: for by faith ye stand.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in
heaviness. 
\v 2 For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same
which is made sorry by me? 
\v 3 And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow
from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my
joy is \add the joy\add* of you all. 
\v 4 For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with
many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love
which I have more abundantly unto you. 
\v 5 But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I
may not overcharge you all. 
\v 6 Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which \add was inflicted
\add* of many. 
\v 7 So that contrariwise ye \add ought\add* rather to forgive \add him,
\add* and comfort \add him,\add* lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed
up with overmuch sorrow. 
\v 8 Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm \add your\add* love toward
him. 
\v 9 For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you,
whether ye be obedient in all things. 
\v 10 To whom ye forgive any thing, I \add forgive\add* also: for if I forgave
any thing, to whom I forgave \add it,\add* for your sakes \add forgave I it
\add* in the person of Christ; 
\v 11 Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his
devices. 
\v 12 Furthermore, when I came to Troas to \add preach\add* Christ’s gospel,
and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 
\v 13 I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but
taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia. 
\v 14 Now thanks \add be\add* unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in
Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
\v 15 For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved,
and in them that perish: 
\v 16 To the one \add we are\add* the savour of death unto death; and to the
other the savour of life unto life. And who \add is\add* sufficient for these
things? 
\v 17 For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of
sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some \add others,
\add* epistles of commendation to you, or \add letters\add* of commendation
from you? 
\v 2 Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men: 
\v 3 \add Forasmuch as ye are\add* manifestly declared to be the epistle of
Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the
living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
\p
\v 4 And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward: 
\v 5 Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of
ourselves; but our sufficiency \add is\add* of God; 
\v 6 Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the
letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth
life. 
\v 7 But if the ministration of death, written \add and\add* engraven in
stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly
behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which \add glory
\add* was to be done away: 
\v 8 How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious? 
\v 9 For if the ministration of condemnation \add be\add* glory, much more
doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. 
\v 10 For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by
reason of the glory that excelleth. 
\v 11 For if that which is done away \add was\add* glorious, much more that
which remaineth \add is\add* glorious. 
\v 12 Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech: 
\v 13 And not as Moses, \add which\add* put a vail over his face, that the
children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is
abolished: 
\v 14 But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail
untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which \add vail\add* is done
away in Christ. 
\v 15 But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their
heart. 
\v 16 Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken
away. 
\v 17 Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord 
\add is,\add* there \add is\add* liberty. 
\v 18 But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, \add even
\add* as by the Spirit of the Lord.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we
faint not; 
\v 2 But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in
craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of
the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
\v 3 But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: 
\v 4 In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which
believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image
of God, should shine unto them. 
\v 5 For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves
your servants for Jesus’ sake. 
\v 6 For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in
our hearts, to \add give\add* the light of the knowledge of the glory of God
in the face of Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the
power may be of God, and not of us. 
\v 8 \add We are\add* troubled on every side, yet not distressed; \add we are
\add* perplexed, but not in despair; 
\v 9 Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed; 
\v 10 Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the
life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. 
\v 11 For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake, that
the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 
\v 12 So then death worketh in us, but life in you. 
\v 13 We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I
believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak; 
\v 14 Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by
Jesus, and shall present \add us\add* with you. 
\v 15 For all things \add are\add* for your sakes, that the abundant grace
might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God. 
\v 16 For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the
inward \add man\add* is renewed day by day. 
\v 17 For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a
far more exceeding \add and\add* eternal weight of glory; 
\v 18 While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which
are not seen: for the things which are seen \add are\add* temporal; but the
things which are not seen \add are\add* eternal.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 For we know that if our earthly house of \add this\add* tabernacle were
dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in
the heavens. 
\v 2 For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our
house which is from heaven: 
\v 3 If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. 
\v 4 For we that are in \add this\add* tabernacle do groan, being burdened:
not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be
swallowed up of life. 
\v 5 Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing \add is\add* God, who
also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. 
\v 6 Therefore \add we are\add* always confident, knowing that, whilst we are
at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord: 
\v 7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:) 
\v 8 We are confident, \add I say,\add* and willing rather to be absent from
the body, and to be present with the Lord. 
\v 9 Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted
of him. 
\v 10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every
one may receive the things \add done\add* in \add his\add* body, according to
that he hath done, whether \add it be\add* good or bad.
\p
\v 11 Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are
made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your
consciences. 
\v 12 For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to
glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to \add answer\add* them which
glory in appearance, and not in heart. 
\v 13 For whether we be beside ourselves, \add it is\add* to God: or whether
we be sober, \add it is\add* for your cause. 
\v 14 For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if
one died for all, then were all dead: 
\v 15 And \add that\add* he died for all, that they which live should not
henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose
again. 
\v 16 Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have
known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we \add him\add* no
more. 
\v 17 Therefore if any man \add be\add* in Christ, \add he is\add* a new
creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. 
\v 18 And all things \add are\add* of God, who hath reconciled us to himself
by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation; 
\v 19 To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not
imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of
reconciliation. 
\v 20 Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech 
\add you\add* by us: we pray \add you\add* in Christ’s stead, be ye reconciled
to God. 
\v 21 For he hath made him \add to be\add* sin for us, who knew no sin; that
we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 We then, \add as\add* workers together \add with him,\add* beseech 
\add you\add* also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. 
\v 2 (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of
salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now \add is\add* the accepted time;
behold, now \add is\add* the day of salvation.) 
\v 3 Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed: 
\v 4 But in all \add things\add* approving ourselves as the ministers of God,
in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 
\v 5 In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in
fastings; 
\v 6 By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy
Ghost, by love unfeigned, 
\v 7 By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness
on the right hand and on the left, 
\v 8 By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers,
and \add yet\add* true; 
\v 9 As unknown, and \add yet\add* well known; as dying, and, behold, we live;
as chastened, and not killed; 
\v 10 As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as
having nothing, and \add yet\add* possessing all things.
\p
\v 11 O \add ye\add* Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is
enlarged. 
\v 12 Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels. 
\v 13 Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto \add my\add*
children,) be ye also enlarged. 
\v 14 Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship
hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with
darkness? 
\v 15 And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that
believeth with an infidel? 
\v 16 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the
temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in
\add them;\add* and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 
\v 17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord,
and touch not the unclean \add thing;\add* and I will receive you, 
\v 18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters,
saith the Lord Almighty.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves
from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear
of God.
\p
\v 2 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have
defrauded no man. 
\v 3 I speak not \add this\add* to condemn \add you:\add* for I have said
before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with \add you. \add*
\v 4 Great \add is\add* my boldness of speech toward you, great \add is
\add* my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in
all our tribulation. 
\v 5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were
troubled on every side; without \add were\add* fightings, within \add were
\add* fears. 
\v 6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us
by the coming of Titus; 
\v 7 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was
comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your
fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more. 
\v 8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did
repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though 
\add it were\add* but for a season. 
\v 9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to
repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive
damage by us in nothing. 
\v 10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of:
but the sorrow of the world worketh death. 
\v 11 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort,
what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, \add what\add* clearing of
yourselves, yea, \add what\add* indignation, yea, \add what\add* fear, yea, 
\add what\add* vehement desire, yea, \add what\add* zeal, yea, \add what
\add* revenge! In all \add things\add* ye have approved yourselves to be clear
in this matter. 
\v 12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, \add I did it\add* not for his cause
that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our
care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you. 
\v 13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the
more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you
all. 
\v 14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as
we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which \add I made
\add* before Titus, is found a truth. 
\v 15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received
him. 
\v 16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all \add things.
\add*
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the
churches of Macedonia; 
\v 2 How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and
their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality. 
\v 3 For to \add their\add* power, I bear record, yea, and beyond \add their
\add* power \add they were\add* willing of themselves; 
\v 4 Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and 
\add take upon us\add* the fellowship of the ministering to the saints. 
\v 5 And \add this they did,\add* not as we hoped, but first gave their own
selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God. 
\v 6 Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also
finish in you the same grace also. 
\v 7 Therefore, as ye abound in every \add thing, in\add* faith, and
utterance, and knowledge, and \add in\add* all diligence, and \add in
\add* your love to us, \add see\add* that ye abound in this grace also. 
\v 8 I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others,
and to prove the sincerity of your love. 
\v 9 For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich,
yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.
\v 10 And herein I give \add my\add* advice: for this is expedient for you,
who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago. 
\v 11 Now therefore perform the doing \add of it;\add* that as \add there was
\add* a readiness to will, so \add there may be\add* a performance also out of
that which ye have. 
\v 12 For if there be first a willing mind, \add it is\add* accepted according
to that a man hath, \add and\add* not according to that he hath not. 
\v 13 For \add I mean\add* not that other men be eased, and ye burdened: 
\v 14 But by an equality, \add that\add* now at this time your abundance 
\add may be a supply\add* for their want, that their abundance also may be 
\add a supply\add* for your want: that there may be equality: 
\v 15 As it is written, He that \add had gathered\add* much had nothing over;
and he that \add had gathered\add* little had no lack. 
\v 16 But thanks \add be\add* to God, which put the same earnest care into the
heart of Titus for you. 
\v 17 For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his
own accord he went unto you. 
\v 18 And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel
throughout all the churches; 
\v 19 And not \add that\add* only, but who was also chosen of the churches to
travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of
the same Lord, and \add declaration of\add* your ready mind: 
\v 20 Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is
administered by us: 
\v 21 Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also
in the sight of men. 
\v 22 And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved
diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence
which \add I have\add* in you. 
\v 23 Whether \add any do enquire\add* of Titus, \add he is\add* my partner
and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren \add be enquired of, they
are\add* the messengers of the churches, \add and\add* the glory of Christ. 
\v 24 Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your
love, and of our boasting on your behalf.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me
to write to you: 
\v 2 For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them
of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked
very many. 
\v 3 Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain
in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready: 
\v 4 Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we
(that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting. 
\v 5 Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would
go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice
before, that the same might be ready, as \add a matter of\add* bounty, and not
as \add of\add* covetousness. 
\v 6 But this \add I say,\add* He which soweth sparingly shall reap also
sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully. 
\v 7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, \add so let him give;
\add* not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 
\v 8 And God \add is\add* able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye,
always having all sufficiency in all \add things,\add* may abound to every
good work: 
\v 9 (As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor:
his righteousness remaineth for ever. 
\v 10 Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for 
\add your\add* food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of
your righteousness;) 
\v 11 Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth
through us thanksgiving to God. 
\v 12 For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of
the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God; 
\v 13 Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your
professed subjection into the gospel of Christ, and for \add your\add* liberal
distribution unto them, and unto all \add men; \add*
\v 14 And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding
grace of God in you. 
\v 15 Thanks \add be\add* unto God for his unspeakable gift.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ,
who in presence \add am\add* base among you, but being absent am bold toward
you: 
\v 2 But I beseech \add you,\add* that I may not be bold when I am present
with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think
of us as if we walked according to the flesh. 
\v 3 For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh: 
\v 4 (For the weapons of our warfare \add are\add* not carnal, but mighty
through God to the pulling down of strong holds;) 
\v 5 Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself
against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the
obedience of Christ; 
\v 6 And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your
obedience is fulfilled. 
\v 7 Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to
himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he
\add is\add* Christ’s, even so \add are\add* we Christ’s. 
\v 8 For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord
hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be
ashamed: 
\v 9 That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters. 
\v 10 For \add his\add* letters, say they, \add are\add* weighty and powerful;
but \add his\add* bodily presence \add is\add* weak, and \add his\add* speech
contemptible. 
\v 11 Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when
we are absent, such \add will we be\add* also in deed when we are present. 
\v 12 For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with
some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and
comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise. 
\v 13 But we will not boast of things without \add our\add* measure, but
according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a
measure to reach even unto you. 
\v 14 For we stretch not ourselves beyond \add our measure,\add* as though we
reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in \add preaching
\add* the gospel of Christ: 
\v 15 Not boasting of things without \add our\add* measure, \add that is,
\add* of other men’s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased,
that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly, 
\v 16 To preach the gospel in the \add regions\add* beyond you, \add and
\add* not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand. 
\v 17 But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. 
\v 18 For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord
commendeth.

\v 1 Would to God ye could bear with me a little in \add my\add* folly: and
indeed bear with me. 
\v 2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to
one husband, that I may present \add you as\add* a chaste virgin to Christ. 
\v 3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his
subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in
Christ. 
\v 4 For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached,
or \add if\add* ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or
another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with 
\add him. \add*
\v 5 For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles. 
\v 6 But though \add I be\add* rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we
have been throughly made manifest among you in all things. 
\v 7 Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted,
because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely? 
\v 8 I robbed other churches, taking wages \add of them,\add* to do you
service. 
\v 9 And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man:
for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia
supplied: and in all \add things\add* I have kept myself from being burdensome
unto you, and so will I keep \add myself. \add*
\v 10 As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting
in the regions of Achaia. 
\v 11 Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth. 
\v 12 But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them
which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
\v 13 For such \add are\add* false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming
themselves into the apostles of Christ. 
\v 14 And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
\v 15 Therefore \add it is\add* no great thing if his ministers also be
transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to
their works.
\p
\v 16 I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool
receive me, that I may boast myself a little. 
\v 17 That which I speak, I speak \add it\add* not after the Lord, but as it
were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting. 
\v 18 Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also. 
\v 19 For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye \add yourselves\add* are wise. 
\v 20 For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour 
\add you,\add* if a man take \add of you,\add* if a man exalt himself, if a
man smite you on the face. 
\v 21 I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit
whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also. 
\v 22 Are they Hebrews? so \add am\add* I. Are they Israelites? so \add am
\add* I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so \add am\add* I. 
\v 23 Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I \add am\add* more;
in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent,
in deaths oft. 
\v 24 Of the Jews five times received I forty \add stripes\add* save one. 
\v 25 Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered
shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep; 
\v 26 \add In\add* journeyings often, \add in\add* perils of waters, 
\add in\add* perils of robbers, \add in\add* perils by \add mine own
\add* countrymen, \add in\add* perils by the heathen, \add in\add* perils in
the city, \add in\add* perils in the wilderness, \add in\add* perils in the
sea, \add in\add* perils among false brethren; 
\v 27 In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst,
in fastings often, in cold and nakedness. 
\v 28 Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily,
the care of all the churches. 
\v 29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? 
\v 30 If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine
infirmities. 
\v 31 The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for
evermore, knoweth that I lie not. 
\v 32 In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the
Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me: 
\v 33 And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped
his hands.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and
revelations of the Lord. 
\v 2 I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I
cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an
one caught up to the third heaven. 
\v 3 And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot
tell: God knoweth;) 
\v 4 How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words,
which it is not lawful for a man to utter. 
\v 5 Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine
infirmities. 
\v 6 For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say
the truth: but \add now\add* I forbear, lest any man should think of me above
that which he seeth me \add to be,\add* or \add that\add* he heareth of me. 
\v 7 And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the
revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of
Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. 
\v 8 For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.
\v 9 And he said unto me, \wj My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength
is made perfect in weakness.\wj* Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in
my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. 
\v 10 Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities,
in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am
I strong.
\p
\v 11 I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to
have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest
apostles, though I be nothing. 
\v 12 Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in
signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. 
\v 13 For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except 
\add it be\add* that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this
wrong. 
\v 14 Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be
burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not
to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. 
\v 15 And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more
abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. 
\v 16 But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught
you with guile. 
\v 17 Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you? 
\v 18 I desired Titus, and with \add him\add* I sent a brother. Did Titus make
a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? \add walked we\add* not in
the same steps? 
\v 19 Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God
in Christ: but \add we do\add* all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
\v 20 For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and
\add that\add* I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest 
\add there be\add* debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings,
whisperings, swellings, tumults: 
\v 21 \add And\add* lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you,
and \add that\add* I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not
repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have
committed.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 This \add is\add* the third \add time\add* I am coming to you. In the
mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. 
\v 2 I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second
time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and
to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare: 
\v 3 Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not
weak, but is mighty in you. 
\v 4 For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power
of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power
of God toward you. 
\v 5 Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves.
Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be
reprobates? 
\v 6 But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates. 
\v 7 Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved,
but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates. 
\v 8 For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth. 
\v 9 For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we
wish, \add even\add* your perfection. 
\v 10 Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should
use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to
edification, and not to destruction.
\p
\v 11 Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one
mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you. 
\v 12 Greet one another with an holy kiss.
\p
\v 13 All the saints salute you. 
\v 14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the
communion of the Holy Ghost, \add be\add* with you all. Amen.
