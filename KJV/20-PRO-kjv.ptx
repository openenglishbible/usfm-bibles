\mt The Proverbs 
\c 1
\p
\v 1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 
\v 2 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding; 
\v 3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
\v 4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
discretion. 
\v 5 A wise \add man\add* will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 
\v 6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise,
and their dark sayings.
\p
\v 7 The fear of the LORD \add is\add* the beginning of knowledge: \add but
\add* fools despise wisdom and instruction. 
\v 8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of
thy mother: 
\v 9 For they \add shall be\add* an ornament of grace unto thy head, and
chains about thy neck.
\p
\v 10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not. 
\v 11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk
privily for the innocent without cause: 
\v 12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go
down into the pit: 
\v 13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with
spoil: 
\v 14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse: 
\v 15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their
path: 
\v 16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. 
\v 17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. 
\v 18 And they lay wait for their \add own\add* blood; they lurk privily for
their \add own\add* lives. 
\v 19 So \add are\add* the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; 
\add which\add* taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
\p
\v 20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets: 
\v 21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the
gates: in the city she uttereth her words, \add saying, \add*
\v 22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners
delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge? 
\v 23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I
will make known my words unto you.
\p
\v 24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and
no man regarded; 
\v 25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
\v 26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 
\v 27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a
whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you. 
\v 28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me
early, but they shall not find me: 
\v 29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
\v 30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. 
\v 31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled
with their own devices. 
\v 32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity
of fools shall destroy them. 
\v 33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from
fear of evil.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with
thee; 
\v 2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, \add and\add* apply thine
heart to understanding; 
\v 3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, \add and\add* liftest up thy voice
for understanding; 
\v 4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as \add for
\add* hid treasures; 
\v 5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge
of God. 
\v 6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth \add cometh\add* knowledge
and understanding. 
\v 7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: \add he is\add* a buckler to
them that walk uprightly. 
\v 8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints. 
\v 9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; 
\add yea,\add* every good path.
\p
\v 10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto
thy soul; 
\v 11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee: 
\v 12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil \add man,\add* from the man
that speaketh froward things; 
\v 13 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 
\v 14 Who rejoice to do evil, \add and\add* delight in the frowardness of the
wicked; 
\v 15 Whose ways \add are\add* crooked, and \add they\add* froward in their
paths: 
\v 16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, \add even\add* from the stranger
\add which\add* flattereth with her words; 
\v 17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of
her God. 
\v 18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead. 
\v 19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths
of life. 
\v 20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good \add men,\add* and keep the
paths of the righteous. 
\v 21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in
it. 
\v 22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors
shall be rooted out of it.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: 
\v 2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee. 
\v 3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write
them upon the table of thine heart: 
\v 4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and
man.
\p
\v 5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own
understanding. 
\v 6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
\p
\v 7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil. 
\v 8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones. 
\v 9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine
increase: 
\v 10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst
out with new wine.
\p
\v 11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his
correction: 
\v 12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son 
\add in whom\add* he delighteth.
\p
\v 13 Happy \add is\add* the man \add that\add* findeth wisdom, and the man 
\add that\add* getteth understanding. 
\v 14 For the merchandise of it \add is\add* better than the merchandise of
silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. 
\v 15 She \add is\add* more precious than rubies: and all the things thou
canst desire are not to be compared unto her. 
\v 16 Length of days \add is\add* in her right hand; \add and\add* in her left
hand riches and honour. 
\v 17 Her ways \add are\add* ways of pleasantness, and all her paths 
\add are\add* peace. 
\v 18 She \add is\add* a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and
happy \add is every one\add* that retaineth her. 
\v 19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he
established the heavens. 
\v 20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the
dew.
\p
\v 21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and
discretion: 
\v 22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck. 
\v 23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
\v 24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie
down, and thy sleep shall be sweet. 
\v 25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked,
when it cometh. 
\v 26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being
taken.
\p
\v 27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power
of thine hand to do \add it. \add*
\v 28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will
give; when thou hast it by thee. 
\v 29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by
thee.
\p
\v 30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
\p
\v 31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways. 
\v 32 For the froward \add is\add* abomination to the LORD: but his secret 
\add is\add* with the righteous.
\p
\v 33 The curse of the LORD \add is\add* in the house of the wicked: but he
blesseth the habitation of the just. 
\v 34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly. 
\v 35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of
fools.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know
understanding. 
\v 2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law. 
\v 3 For I was my father’s son, tender and only \add beloved\add* in the sight
of my mother. 
\v 4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words:
keep my commandments, and live. 
\v 5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget \add it\add* not; neither decline
from the words of my mouth. 
\v 6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall
keep thee. 
\v 7 Wisdom \add is\add* the principal thing; \add therefore\add* get wisdom:
and with all thy getting get understanding. 
\v 8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour,
when thou dost embrace her. 
\v 9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall
she deliver to thee. 
\v 10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall
be many. 
\v 11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right
paths. 
\v 12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou
runnest, thou shalt not stumble. 
\v 13 Take fast hold of instruction; let \add her\add* not go: keep her; for
she \add is\add* thy life.
\p
\v 14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil 
\add men. \add*
\v 15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away. 
\v 16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is
taken away, unless they cause \add some\add* to fall. 
\v 17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. 
\v 18 But the path of the just \add is\add* as the shining light, that shineth
more and more unto the perfect day. 
\v 19 The way of the wicked \add is\add* as darkness: they know not at what
they stumble.
\p
\v 20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings. 
\v 21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine
heart. 
\v 22 For they \add are\add* life unto those that find them, and health to all
their flesh.
\p
\v 23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it \add are\add* the
issues of life. 
\v 24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from
thee. 
\v 25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before
thee. 
\v 26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established. 
\v 27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 My son, attend unto my wisdom, \add and\add* bow thine ear to my
understanding: 
\v 2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and \add that\add* thy lips may keep
knowledge.
\p
\v 3 For the lips of a strange woman drop \add as\add* an honeycomb, and her
mouth \add is\add* smoother than oil: 
\v 4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword. 
\v 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell. 
\v 6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, 
\add that\add* thou canst not know \add them. \add*
\v 7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my
mouth. 
\v 8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house: 
\v 9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel: 
\v 10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours \add be
\add* in the house of a stranger; 
\v 11 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 
\v 12 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 
\v 13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to
them that instructed me! 
\v 14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
\p
\v 15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine
own well. 
\v 16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, \add and\add* rivers of waters in
the streets. 
\v 17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee. 
\v 18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 
\v 19 \add Let her be as\add* the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her
breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
\v 20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace
the bosom of a stranger? 
\v 21 For the ways of man \add are\add* before the eyes of the LORD, and he
pondereth all his goings.
\p
\v 22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden
with the cords of his sins. 
\v 23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he
shall go astray.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, \add if\add* thou hast stricken
thy hand with a stranger, 
\v 2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the
words of thy mouth. 
\v 3 Do this now, my son, deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of
thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend. 
\v 4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 
\v 5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand \add of the hunter,\add* and as a
bird from the hand of the fowler.
\p
\v 6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 
\v 7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 
\v 8 Provideth her meat in the summer, \add and\add* gathereth her food in the
harvest. 
\v 9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy
sleep? 
\v 10 \add Yet\add* a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
hands to sleep: 
\v 11 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an
armed man.
\p
\v 12 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth. 
\v 13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with
his fingers; 
\v 14 Frowardness \add is\add* in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;
he soweth discord. 
\v 15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken
without remedy.
\p
\v 16 These six \add things\add* doth the LORD hate: yea, seven \add are
\add* an abomination unto him: 
\v 17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, 
\v 18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in
running to mischief, 
\v 19 A false witness \add that\add* speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord
among brethren.
\p
\v 20 My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy
mother: 
\v 21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, \add and\add* tie them about thy
neck. 
\v 22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep
thee; and \add when\add* thou awakest, it shall talk with thee. 
\v 23 For the commandment \add is\add* a lamp; and the law \add is\add* light;
and reproofs of instruction \add are\add* the way of life: 
\v 24 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a
strange woman. 
\v 25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with
her eyelids. 
\v 26 For by means of a whorish woman \add a man is brought\add* to a piece of
bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life. 
\v 27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned? 
\v 28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned? 
\v 29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her
shall not be innocent. 
\v 30 \add Men\add* do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul
when he is hungry; 
\v 31 But \add if\add* he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give
all the substance of his house. 
\v 32 \add But\add* whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
understanding: he \add that\add* doeth it destroyeth his own soul. 
\v 33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped
away. 
\v 34 For jealousy \add is\add* the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare
in the day of vengeance. 
\v 35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou
givest many gifts.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee. 
\v 2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye. 
\v 3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart. 
\v 4 Say unto wisdom, Thou \add art\add* my sister; and call understanding 
\add thy\add* kinswoman: 
\v 5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger 
\add which\add* flattereth with her words.
\p
\v 6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 
\v 7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young
man void of understanding, 
\v 8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her
house, 
\v 9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night: 
\v 10 And, behold, there met him a woman \add with\add* the attire of an
harlot, and subtil of heart. 
\v 11 (She \add is\add* loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 
\v 12 Now \add is she\add* without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at
every corner.) 
\v 13 So she caught him, and kissed him, \add and\add* with an impudent face
said unto him, 
\v 14 \add I have\add* peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my
vows. 
\v 15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I
have found thee. 
\v 16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved \add works,
\add* with fine linen of Egypt. 
\v 17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
\v 18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace
ourselves with loves. 
\v 19 For the goodman \add is\add* not at home, he is gone a long journey: 
\v 20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, \add and\add* will come home at
the day appointed. 
\v 21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering
of her lips she forced him. 
\v 22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a
fool to the correction of the stocks; 
\v 23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare,
and knoweth not that it \add is\add* for his life.
\p
\v 24 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of
my mouth. 
\v 25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths. 
\v 26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong \add men
\add* have been slain by her. 
\v 27 Her house \add is\add* the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
death.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice? 
\v 2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the
paths. 
\v 3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at
the doors. 
\v 4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice \add is\add* to the sons of man. 
\v 5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding
heart. 
\v 6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips 
\add shall be\add* right things. 
\v 7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness \add is\add* an
abomination to my lips. 
\v 8 All the words of my mouth \add are\add* in righteousness; \add there is
\add* nothing froward or perverse in them. 
\v 9 They \add are\add* all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them
that find knowledge. 
\v 10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice
gold. 
\v 11 For wisdom \add is\add* better than rubies; and all the things that may
be desired are not to be compared to it. 
\v 12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
inventions. 
\v 13 The fear of the LORD \add is\add* to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy,
and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate. 
\v 14 Counsel \add is\add* mine, and sound wisdom: I \add am\add*
understanding; I have strength. 
\v 15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 
\v 16 By me princes rule, and nobles, \add even\add* all the judges of the
earth. 
\v 17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me. 
\v 18 Riches and honour \add are\add* with me; \add yea,\add* durable riches
and righteousness. 
\v 19 My fruit \add is\add* better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my
revenue than choice silver. 
\v 20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of
judgment: 
\v 21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will
fill their treasures. 
\v 22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of
old. 
\v 23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth
was. 
\v 24 When \add there were\add* no depths, I was brought forth; when 
\add there were\add* no fountains abounding with water. 
\v 25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought
forth: 
\v 26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest
part of the dust of the world. 
\v 27 When he prepared the heavens, I \add was\add* there: when he set a
compass upon the face of the depth: 
\v 28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains
of the deep: 
\v 29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his
commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth: 
\v 30 Then I was by him, \add as\add* one brought up \add with him:
\add* and I was daily \add his\add* delight, rejoicing always before him; 
\v 31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights 
\add were\add* with the sons of men. 
\v 32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed \add are they
that\add* keep my ways. 
\v 33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not. 
\v 34 Blessed \add is\add* the man that heareth me, watching daily at my
gates, waiting at the posts of my doors. 
\v 35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
\v 36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate
me love death.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars: 
\v 2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also
furnished her table. 
\v 3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of
the city, 
\v 4 Whoso \add is\add* simple, let him turn in hither: \add as for
\add* him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 
\v 5 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine \add which\add* I have
mingled. 
\v 6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding. 
\v 7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that
rebuketh a wicked \add man getteth\add* himself a blot. 
\v 8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will
love thee. 
\v 9 Give \add instruction\add* to a wise \add man,\add* and he will be yet
wiser: teach a just \add man,\add* and he will increase in learning. 
\v 10 The fear of the LORD \add is\add* the beginning of wisdom: and the
knowledge of the holy \add is\add* understanding. 
\v 11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall
be increased. 
\v 12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but \add if\add* thou
scornest, thou alone shalt bear \add it.\add*
\p
\v 13 A foolish woman \add is\add* clamorous: \add she is\add* simple, and
knoweth nothing. 
\v 14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places
of the city, 
\v 15 To call passengers who go right on their ways: 
\v 16 Whoso \add is\add* simple, let him turn in hither: and \add as for
\add* him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 
\v 17 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread \add eaten\add* in secret is
pleasant. 
\v 18 But he knoweth not that the dead \add are\add* there; \add and that
\add* her guests \add are\add* in the depths of hell.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish
son \add is\add* the heaviness of his mother. 
\v 2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from
death. 
\v 3 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he
casteth away the substance of the wicked. 
\v 4 He becometh poor that dealeth \add with\add* a slack hand: but the hand
of the diligent maketh rich. 
\v 5 He that gathereth in summer \add is\add* a wise son: \add but\add* he
that sleepeth in harvest \add is\add* a son that causeth shame. 
\v 6 Blessings \add are\add* upon the head of the just: but violence covereth
the mouth of the wicked. 
\v 7 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.
\v 8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall
fall. 
\v 9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways
shall be known. 
\v 10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall
fall. 
\v 11 The mouth of a righteous \add man is\add* a well of life: but violence
covereth the mouth of the wicked. 
\v 12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins. 
\v 13 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod 
\add is\add* for the back of him that is void of understanding. 
\v 14 Wise \add men\add* lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish 
\add is\add* near destruction. 
\v 15 The rich man’s wealth \add is\add* his strong city: the destruction of
the poor \add is\add* their poverty. 
\v 16 The labour of the righteous \add tendeth\add* to life: the fruit of the
wicked to sin. 
\v 17 He \add is in\add* the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
refuseth reproof erreth. 
\v 18 He that hideth hatred \add with\add* lying lips, and he that uttereth a
slander, \add is\add* a fool. 
\v 19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth
his lips \add is\add* wise. 
\v 20 The tongue of the just \add is as\add* choice silver: the heart of the
wicked \add is\add* little worth. 
\v 21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom. 
\v 22 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with
it. 
\v 23 \add It is\add* as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
understanding hath wisdom. 
\v 24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the
righteous shall be granted. 
\v 25 As the whirlwind passeth, so \add is\add* the wicked no \add more:
\add* but the righteous \add is\add* an everlasting foundation. 
\v 26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so \add is
\add* the sluggard to them that send him. 
\v 27 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall
be shortened. 
\v 28 The hope of the righteous \add shall be\add* gladness: but the
expectation of the wicked shall perish. 
\v 29 The way of the LORD \add is\add* strength to the upright: but
destruction \add shall be\add* to the workers of iniquity. 
\v 30 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit
the earth. 
\v 31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue
shall be cut out. 
\v 32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the
wicked \add speaketh\add* frowardness.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 A false balance \add is\add* abomination to the LORD: but a just weight 
\add is\add* his delight. 
\v 2 \add When\add* pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly 
\add is\add* wisdom. 
\v 3 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of
transgressors shall destroy them. 
\v 4 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from
death. 
\v 5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked
shall fall by his own wickedness. 
\v 6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors
shall be taken in \add their own\add* naughtiness. 
\v 7 When a wicked man dieth, \add his\add* expectation shall perish: and the
hope of unjust \add men\add* perisheth. 
\v 8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his
stead. 
\v 9 An hypocrite with \add his\add* mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but
through knowledge shall the just be delivered. 
\v 10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the
wicked perish, \add there is\add* shouting. 
\v 11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown
by the mouth of the wicked. 
\v 12 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of
understanding holdeth his peace. 
\v 13 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit
concealeth the matter. 
\v 14 Where no counsel \add is,\add* the people fall: but in the multitude of
counsellors \add there is\add* safety. 
\v 15 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart \add for it:\add* and he
that hateth suretiship is sure. 
\v 16 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong \add men\add* retain
riches. 
\v 17 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but \add he that is
\add* cruel troubleth his own flesh. 
\v 18 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth
righteousness \add shall be\add* a sure reward. 
\v 19 As righteousness \add tendeth\add* to life: so he that pursueth evil 
\add pursueth it\add* to his own death. 
\v 20 They that are of a froward heart \add are\add* abomination to the LORD:
but \add such as are\add* upright in \add their\add* way \add are\add* his
delight. 
\v 21 \add Though\add* hand \add join\add* in hand, the wicked shall not be
unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered. 
\v 22 \add As\add* a jewel of gold in a swine’s snout, \add so is\add* a fair
woman which is without discretion. 
\v 23 The desire of the righteous \add is\add* only good: \add but\add* the
expectation of the wicked \add is\add* wrath. 
\v 24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and \add there is
\add* that withholdeth more than is meet, but \add it tendeth\add* to
poverty. 
\v 25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be
watered also himself. 
\v 26 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing 
\add shall be\add* upon the head of him that selleth \add it. \add*
\v 27 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh
mischief, it shall come unto him. 
\v 28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall
flourish as a branch. 
\v 29 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool 
\add shall be\add* servant to the wise of heart. 
\v 30 The fruit of the righteous \add is\add* a tree of life; and he that
winneth souls \add is\add* wise. 
\v 31 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the
wicked and the sinner.

\p
\v 1 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof 
\add is\add* brutish. 
\v 2 A good \add man\add* obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked
devices will he condemn. 
\v 3 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the
righteous shall not be moved. 
\v 4 A virtuous woman \add is\add* a crown to her husband: but she that maketh
ashamed \add is\add* as rottenness in his bones. 
\v 5 The thoughts of the righteous \add are\add* right: \add but\add* the
counsels of the wicked \add are\add* deceit. 
\v 6 The words of the wicked \add are\add* to lie in wait for blood: but the
mouth of the upright shall deliver them. 
\v 7 The wicked are overthrown, and \add are\add* not: but the house of the
righteous shall stand. 
\v 8 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a
perverse heart shall be despised. 
\v 9 \add He that is\add* despised, and hath a servant, \add is\add* better
than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread. 
\v 10 A righteous \add man\add* regardeth the life of his beast: but the
tender mercies of the wicked \add are\add* cruel. 
\v 11 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that
followeth vain \add persons is\add* void of understanding. 
\v 12 The wicked desireth the net of evil \add men:\add* but the root of the
righteous yieldeth \add fruit. \add*
\v 13 The wicked is snared by the transgression of \add his\add* lips: but the
just shall come out of trouble. 
\v 14 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of \add his\add* mouth:
and the recompense of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him. 
\v 15 The way of a fool \add is\add* right in his own eyes: but he that
hearkeneth unto counsel \add is\add* wise. 
\v 16 A fool’s wrath is presently known: but a prudent \add man\add* covereth
shame. 
\v 17 \add He that\add* speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a
false witness deceit. 
\v 18 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of
the wise \add is\add* health. 
\v 19 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue 
\add is\add* but for a moment. 
\v 20 Deceit \add is\add* in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the
counsellors of peace \add is\add* joy. 
\v 21 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled
with mischief. 
\v 22 Lying lips \add are\add* abomination to the LORD: but they that deal
truly \add are\add* his delight. 
\v 23 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth
foolishness. 
\v 24 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be
under tribute. 
\v 25 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it
glad. 
\v 26 The righteous \add is\add* more excellent than his neighbour: but the
way of the wicked seduceth them. 
\v 27 The slothful \add man\add* roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
but the substance of a diligent man \add is\add* precious. 
\v 28 In the way of righteousness \add is\add* life; and \add in\add* the

\c 13

\v 1 A wise son \add heareth\add* his father’s instruction: but a scorner

\v 3 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: \add but\add* he that openeth
wide his lips shall have destruction. 
\v 4 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and \add hath\add* nothing: but the
soul of the diligent shall be made fat. 
\v 5 A righteous \add man\add* hateth lying: but a wicked \add man\add* is
loathsome, and cometh to shame. 
\v 6 Righteousness keepeth \add him that is\add* upright in the way: but
wickedness overthroweth the sinner. 
\v 7 There is that maketh himself rich, yet \add hath\add* nothing: 
\add there is\add* that maketh himself poor, yet \add hath\add* great riches.
\v 8 The ransom of a man’s life \add are\add* his riches: but the poor heareth
not rebuke. 
\v 9 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be
put out. 
\v 10 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised \add is
\add* wisdom. 
\v 11 Wealth \add gotten\add* by vanity shall be diminished: but he that
gathereth by labour shall increase. 
\v 12 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but \add when\add* the desire
cometh, \add it is\add* a tree of life. 
\v 13 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the
commandment shall be rewarded. 
\v 14 The law of the wise \add is\add* a fountain of life, to depart from the
snares of death. 
\v 15 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors 
\add is\add* hard. 
\v 16 Every prudent \add man\add* dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth
open \add his\add* folly. 
\v 17 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador 
\add is\add* health. 
\v 18 Poverty and shame \add shall be to\add* him that refuseth instruction:
but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured. 
\v 19 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but \add it is\add*
abomination to fools to depart from evil. 
\v 20 He that walketh with wise \add men\add* shall be wise: but a companion
of fools shall be destroyed. 
\v 21 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repaid. 
\v 22 A good \add man\add* leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children:
and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just. 
\v 23 Much food \add is in\add* the tillage of the poor: but there is 
\add that is\add* destroyed for want of judgment. 
\v 24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him
chasteneth him betimes. 
\v 25 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the
wicked shall want.

\v 1 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down
with her hands. 
\v 2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but \add he that is
\add* perverse in his ways despiseth him. 
\v 3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise
shall preserve them. 
\v 4 Where no oxen \add are,\add* the crib \add is\add* clean: but much
increase \add is\add* by the strength of the ox. 
\v 5 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies. 
\v 6 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and \add findeth it\add* not: but knowledge 
\add is\add* easy unto him that understandeth. 
\v 7 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not 
\add in him\add* the lips of knowledge. 
\v 8 The wisdom of the prudent \add is\add* to understand his way: but the
folly of fools \add is\add* deceit. 
\v 9 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous \add there is
\add* favour. 
\v 10 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
intermeddle with his joy. 
\v 11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the
upright shall flourish. 
\v 12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof 
\add are\add* the ways of death. 
\v 13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth 
\add is\add* heaviness. 
\v 14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good
man \add shall be satisfied\add* from himself. 
\v 15 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent \add man\add* looketh
well to his going. 
\v 16 A wise \add man\add* feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool
rageth, and is confident. 
\v 17 \add He that is\add* soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked
devices is hated. 
\v 18 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge. 
\v 19 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the
righteous. 
\v 20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich \add hath
\add* many friends. 
\v 21 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the
poor, happy \add is\add* he. 
\v 22 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth \add shall be

\v 23 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips \add tendeth
\add* only to penury. 
\v 24 The crown of the wise is their riches: \add but\add* the foolishness of
fools \add is\add* folly. 
\v 25 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful \add witness
\add* speaketh lies. 
\v 26 In the fear of the LORD \add is\add* strong confidence: and his children

\v 27 The fear of the LORD \add is\add* a fountain of life, to depart from the

in his death. 
\v 33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but 
\add that which is\add* in the midst of fools is made known. 
\v 34 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin \add is\add* a reproach to any

\v 1 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.

\v 3 The eyes of the LORD \add are\add* in every place, beholding the evil and
the good. 
\v 4 A wholesome tongue \add is\add* a tree of life: but perverseness therein

\v 5 A fool despiseth his father’s instruction: but he that regardeth reproof
is prudent. 
\v 6 In the house of the righteous \add is\add* much treasure: but in the

\v 7 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish

\v 8 The sacrifice of the wicked \add is\add* an abomination to the LORD: but
the prayer of the upright \add is\add* his delight. 
\v 9 The way of the wicked \add is\add* an abomination unto the LORD: but he

\v 10 Correction \add is\add* grievous unto him that forsaketh the way:

\v 11 Hell and destruction \add are\add* before the LORD: how much more then
the hearts of the children of men? 
\v 12 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the
wise. 
\v 13 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart
the spirit is broken. 
\v 14 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the
mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness. 
\v 15 All the days of the afflicted \add are\add* evil: but he that is of a
merry heart \add hath\add* a continual feast. 
\v 16 Better \add is\add* little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
and trouble therewith. 
\v 17 Better \add is\add* a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox

\v 18 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but \add he that is\add* slow to
anger appeaseth strife. 
\v 19 The way of the slothful \add man is\add* as an hedge of thorns: but the
way of the righteous \add is\add* made plain. 
\v 20 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his
mother. 
\v 21 Folly \add is\add* joy to \add him that is\add* destitute of wisdom: but
a man of understanding walketh uprightly. 
\v 22 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of
counsellors they are established. 
\v 23 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word \add spoken
\add* in due season, how good \add is it! \add*
\v 24 The way of life \add is\add* above to the wise, that he may depart from
hell beneath. 
\v 25 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the

\add the words\add* of the pure \add are\add* pleasant words. 
\v 27 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth

\v 30 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: \add and\add* a good report

\v 31 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise. 
\v 32 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth
reproof getteth understanding. 
\v 33 The fear of the LORD \add is\add* the instruction of wisdom; and before
honour \add is\add* humility.

\v 1 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue,

\v 3 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established. 
\v 4 The LORD hath made all \add things\add* for himself: yea, even the wicked

\v 7 When a man’s ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at
peace with him. 
\v 8 Better \add is\add* a little with righteousness than great revenues
without right. 
\v 9 A man’s heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps. 
\v 10 A divine sentence \add is\add* in the lips of the king: his mouth
transgresseth not in judgment. 
\v 11 A just weight and balance \add are\add* the LORD’S: all the weights of

\v 12 \add It is\add* an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the
throne is established by righteousness. 
\v 13 Righteous lips \add are\add* the delight of kings; and they love him

\v 15 In the light of the king’s countenance \add is\add* life; and his favour
\add is\add* as a cloud of the latter rain. 
\v 16 How much better \add is it\add* to get wisdom than gold! and to get

\v 17 The highway of the upright \add is\add* to depart from evil: he that

\v 21 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips
increaseth learning. 
\v 22 Understanding \add is\add* a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
but the instruction of fools \add is\add* folly. 
\v 23 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his
lips.

health to the bones. 
\v 25 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof 
\add are\add* the ways of death. 
\v 26 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of
him. 
\v 27 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips \add there is
\add* as a burning fire. 
\v 28 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends. 
\v 29 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way 
\add that is\add* not good. 
\v 30 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he
bringeth evil to pass. 
\v 31 The hoary head \add is\add* a crown of glory, \add if\add* it be found
in the way of righteousness. 
\v 32 \add He that is\add* slow to anger \add is\add* better than the mighty;
and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city. 
\v 33 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof 
\add is\add* of the LORD.
\c 17

\v 1 Better \add is\add* a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house
full of sacrifices \add with\add* strife. 
\v 2 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall
have part of the inheritance among the brethren. 
\v 3 The fining pot \add is\add* for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the
LORD trieth the hearts. 
\v 4 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; \add and\add* a liar giveth ear
to a naughty tongue. 
\v 5 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: \add and\add* he that is
glad at calamities shall not be unpunished. 
\v 6 Children’s children \add are\add* the crown of old men; and the glory of
children \add are\add* their fathers. 
\v 7 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince. 
\v 8 A gift \add is as\add* a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth. 
\v 9 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a
matter separateth \add very\add* friends. 
\v 10 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a
fool. 
\v 11 An evil \add man\add* seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel
messenger shall be sent against him. 
\v 12 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his
folly. 
\v 13 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. 
\v 14 The beginning of strife \add is as\add* when one letteth out water:
therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with. 
\v 15 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even
they both \add are\add* abomination to the LORD. 
\v 16 Wherefore \add is there\add* a price in the hand of a fool to get
wisdom, seeing \add he hath\add* no heart \add to it? \add*
\v 17 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. 
\v 18 A man void of understanding striketh hands, \add and\add* becometh
surety in the presence of his friend. 
\v 19 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: \add and\add* he that
exalteth his gate seeketh destruction. 
\v 20 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a
perverse tongue falleth into mischief. 
\v 21 He that begetteth a fool \add doeth it\add* to his sorrow: and the
father of a fool hath no joy. 
\v 22 A merry heart doeth good \add like\add* a medicine: but a broken spirit
drieth the bones. 
\v 23 A wicked \add man\add* taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the
ways of judgment. 
\v 24 Wisdom \add is\add* before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of
a fool \add are\add* in the ends of the earth. 
\v 25 A foolish son \add is\add* a grief to his father, and bitterness to her
that bare him. 
\v 26 Also to punish the just \add is\add* not good, \add nor\add* to strike
princes for equity. 
\v 27 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: \add and\add* a man of
understanding is of an excellent spirit. 
\v 28 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: \add and
\add* he that shutteth his lips \add is esteemed\add* a man of understanding.
\c 18
\p
\v 1 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh \add and
\add* intermeddleth with all wisdom. 
\v 2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover
itself. 
\v 3 When the wicked cometh, \add then\add* cometh also contempt, and with
ignominy reproach. 
\v 4 The words of a man’s mouth \add are as\add* deep waters, \add and
\add* the wellspring of wisdom \add as\add* a flowing brook. 
\v 5 \add It is\add* not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow
the righteous in judgment. 
\v 6 A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes. 
\v 7 A fool’s mouth \add is\add* his destruction, and his lips \add are
\add* the snare of his soul. 
\v 8 The words of a talebearer \add are\add* as wounds, and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly. 
\v 9 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great
waster. 
\v 10 The name of the LORD \add is\add* a strong tower: the righteous runneth
into it, and is safe. 
\v 11 The rich man’s wealth \add is\add* his strong city, and as an high wall
in his own conceit. 
\v 12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour 
\add is\add* humility. 
\v 13 He that answereth a matter before he heareth \add it,\add* it 
\add is\add* folly and shame unto him. 
\v 14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who
can bear? 
\v 15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise
seeketh knowledge. 
\v 16 A man’s gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men. 
\v 17 \add He that is\add* first in his own cause \add seemeth\add* just; but
his neighbour cometh and searcheth him. 
\v 18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty. 
\v 19 A brother offended \add is harder to be won\add* than a strong city: and
\add their\add* contentions \add are\add* like the bars of a castle. 
\v 20 A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; 
\add and\add* with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. 
\v 21 Death and life \add are\add* in the power of the tongue: and they that
love it shall eat the fruit thereof. 
\v 22 \add Whoso\add* findeth a wife findeth a good \add thing,\add* and
obtaineth favour of the LORD. 
\v 23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly. 
\v 24 A man \add that hath\add* friends must shew himself friendly: and there
is a friend \add that\add* sticketh closer than a brother.
\c 19
\p
\v 1 Better \add is\add* the poor that walketh in his integrity, than 
\add he that is\add* perverse in his lips, and is a fool. 
\v 2 Also, \add that\add* the soul \add be\add* without knowledge, \add it is
\add* not good; and he that hasteth with \add his\add* feet sinneth. 
\v 3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against
the LORD. 
\v 4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
neighbour. 
\v 5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and \add he that\add* speaketh
lies shall not escape. 
\v 6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man \add is
\add* a friend to him that giveth gifts. 
\v 7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go
far from him? he pursueth \add them with\add* words, \add yet\add* they 
\add are\add* wanting \add to him. \add*
\v 8 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: \add he that\add* keepeth
understanding shall find good. 
\v 9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall
perish. 
\v 10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule
over princes. 
\v 11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and \add it is\add* his
glory to pass over a transgression. 
\v 12 The king’s wrath \add is\add* as the roaring of a lion; but his favour 
\add is\add* as dew upon the grass. 
\v 13 A foolish son \add is\add* the calamity of his father: and the
contentions of a wife \add are\add* a continual dropping. 
\v 14 House and riches \add are\add* the inheritance of fathers and a prudent
wife \add is\add* from the LORD. 
\v 15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer
hunger. 
\v 16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; \add but
\add* he that despiseth his ways shall die. 
\v 17 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he
hath given will he pay him again. 
\v 18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his
crying. 
\v 19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver 
\add him,\add* yet thou must do it again. 
\v 20 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy
latter end. 
\v 21 \add There are\add* many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the
counsel of the LORD, that shall stand. 
\v 22 The desire of a man \add is\add* his kindness: and a poor man 
\add is\add* better than a liar. 
\v 23 The fear of the LORD \add tendeth\add* to life: and \add he that hath
it\add* shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil. 
\v 24 A slothful \add man\add* hideth his hand in \add his\add* bosom, and
will not so much as bring it to his mouth again. 
\v 25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath
understanding, \add and\add* he will understand knowledge. 
\v 26 He that wasteth \add his\add* father, \add and\add* chaseth away 
\add his\add* mother, \add is\add* a son that causeth shame, and bringeth
reproach. 
\v 27 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction \add that causeth\add* to err
from the words of knowledge. 
\v 28 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked
devoureth iniquity. 
\v 29 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
\c 20
\p
\v 1 Wine \add is\add* a mocker, strong drink \add is\add* raging: and
whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise. 
\v 2 The fear of a king \add is\add* as the roaring of a lion: \add whoso
\add* provoketh him to anger sinneth \add against\add* his own soul. 
\v 3 \add It is\add* an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool
will be meddling. 
\v 4 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; \add therefore
\add* shall he beg in harvest, and \add have\add* nothing. 
\v 5 Counsel in the heart of man \add is like\add* deep water; but a man of
understanding will draw it out. 
\v 6 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who
can find? 
\v 7 The just \add man\add* walketh in his integrity: his children \add are
\add* blessed after him. 
\v 8 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil
with his eyes. 
\v 9 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin? 
\v 10 Divers weights, \add and\add* divers measures, both of them \add are
\add* alike abomination to the LORD. 
\v 11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work \add be
\add* pure, and whether \add it be\add* right. 
\v 12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of
them. 
\v 13 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, \add and
\add* thou shalt be satisfied with bread. 
\v 14 \add It is\add* naught, \add it is\add* naught, saith the buyer: but
when he is gone his way, then he boasteth. 
\v 15 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge 
\add are\add* a precious jewel. 
\v 16 Take his garment that is surety \add for\add* a stranger: and take a
pledge of him for a strange woman. 
\v 17 Bread of deceit \add is\add* sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth
shall be filled with gravel. 
\v 18 \add Every\add* purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice
make war. 
\v 19 He that goeth about \add as\add* a talebearer revealeth secrets:
therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips. 
\v 20 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in
obscure darkness. 
\v 21 An inheritance \add may be\add* gotten hastily at the beginning; but the
end thereof shall not be blessed. 
\v 22 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; \add but\add* wait on the LORD,
and he shall save thee. 
\v 23 Divers weights \add are\add* an abomination unto the LORD; and a false
balance \add is\add* not good. 
\v 24 Man’s goings \add are\add* of the LORD; how can a man then understand
his own way? 
\v 25 \add It is\add* a snare to the man \add who\add* devoureth \add that
which is\add* holy, and after vows to make enquiry. 
\v 26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them. 
\v 27 The spirit of man \add is\add* the candle of the LORD, searching all the
inward parts of the belly. 
\v 28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.
\v 29 The glory of young men \add is\add* their strength: and the beauty of
old men \add is\add* the grey head. 
\v 30 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so \add do\add* stripes the
inward parts of the belly.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 The king’s heart \add is\add* in the hand of the LORD, \add as
\add* the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will. 
\v 2 Every way of a man \add is\add* right in his own eyes: but the LORD
pondereth the hearts. 
\v 3 To do justice and judgment \add is\add* more acceptable to the LORD than
sacrifice. 
\v 4 An high look, and a proud heart, \add and\add* the plowing of the wicked,
\add is\add* sin. 
\v 5 The thoughts of the diligent \add tend\add* only to plenteousness; but of
every one \add that is\add* hasty only to want. 
\v 6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue \add is\add* a vanity tossed
to and fro of them that seek death. 
\v 7 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do
judgment. 
\v 8 The way of man \add is\add* froward and strange: but \add as for
\add* the pure, his work \add is\add* right. 
\v 9 \add It is\add* better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a
brawling woman in a wide house. 
\v 10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in
his eyes. 
\v 11 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise
is instructed, he receiveth knowledge. 
\v 12 The righteous \add man\add* wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
\add but God\add* overthroweth the wicked for \add their\add* wickedness. 
\v 13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry
himself, but shall not be heard. 
\v 14 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong
wrath. 
\v 15 \add It is\add* joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction 
\add shall be\add* to the workers of iniquity. 
\v 16 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in
the congregation of the dead. 
\v 17 He that loveth pleasure \add shall be\add* a poor man: he that loveth
wine and oil shall not be rich. 
\v 18 The wicked \add shall be\add* a ransom for the righteous, and the
transgressor for the upright. 
\v 19 \add It is\add* better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a
contentious and an angry woman. 
\v 20 \add There is\add* treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up. 
\v 21 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,
righteousness, and honour. 
\v 22 A wise \add man\add* scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down
the strength of the confidence thereof. 
\v 23 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles. 
\v 24 Proud \add and\add* haughty scorner \add is\add* his name, who dealeth
in proud wrath. 
\v 25 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.
\v 26 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and
spareth not. 
\v 27 The sacrifice of the wicked \add is\add* abomination: how much more, 
\add when\add* he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 
\v 28 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh
constantly. 
\v 29 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but \add as for\add* the upright, he
directeth his way. 
\v 30 \add There is\add* no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the
LORD. 
\v 31 The horse \add is\add* prepared against the day of battle: but safety 
\add is\add* of the LORD.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 A \add good\add* name \add is\add* rather to be chosen than great riches,
\add and\add* loving favour rather than silver and gold. 
\v 2 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD \add is\add* the maker of them
all. 
\v 3 A prudent \add man\add* foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the
simple pass on, and are punished. 
\v 4 By humility \add and\add* the fear of the LORD \add are\add* riches, and
honour, and life. 
\v 5 Thorns \add and\add* snares \add are\add* in the way of the froward: he
that doth keep his soul shall be far from them. 
\v 6 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not
depart from it. 
\v 7 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower \add is\add* servant to
the lender. 
\v 8 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall
fail. 
\v 9 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread
to the poor. 
\v 10 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and
reproach shall cease. 
\v 11 He that loveth pureness of heart, \add for\add* the grace of his lips
the king \add shall be\add* his friend. 
\v 12 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words
of the transgressor. 
\v 13 The slothful \add man\add* saith, \add There is\add* a lion without, I
shall be slain in the streets. 
\v 14 The mouth of strange women \add is\add* a deep pit: he that is abhorred
of the LORD shall fall therein. 
\v 15 Foolishness \add is\add* bound in the heart of a child; \add but
\add* the rod of correction shall drive it far from him. 
\v 16 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his \add riches, and\add* he
that giveth to the rich, \add shall\add* surely \add come\add* to want. 
\v 17 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine
heart unto my knowledge. 
\v 18 For \add it is\add* a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they
shall withal be fitted in thy lips. 
\v 19 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day,
even to thee. 
\v 20 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge, 
\v 21 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that
thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee? 
\v 22 Rob not the poor, because he \add is\add* poor: neither oppress the
afflicted in the gate: 
\v 23 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that
spoiled them. 
\v 24 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt
not go: 
\v 25 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul. 
\v 26 Be not thou \add one\add* of them that strike hands, \add or\add* of
them that are sureties for debts. 
\v 27 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under
thee? 
\v 28 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set. 
\v 29 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings;
he shall not stand before mean \add men.\add*
\c 23
\p
\v 1 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what 
\add is\add* before thee: 
\v 2 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou \add be\add* a man given to
appetite. 
\v 3 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they \add are\add* deceitful meat. 
\v 4 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom. 
\v 5 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for \add riches
\add* certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward
heaven. 
\v 6 Eat thou not the bread of \add him that hath\add* an evil eye, neither
desire thou his dainty meats: 
\v 7 For as he thinketh in his heart, so \add is\add* he: Eat and drink, saith
he to thee; but his heart \add is\add* not with thee. 
\v 8 The morsel \add which\add* thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose
thy sweet words. 
\v 9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy
words. 
\v 10 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the
fatherless: 
\v 11 For their redeemer \add is\add* mighty; he shall plead their cause with
thee. 
\v 12 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of
knowledge. 
\v 13 Withhold not correction from the child: for \add if\add* thou beatest
him with the rod, he shall not die. 
\v 14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.
\v 15 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine. 
\v 16 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things. 
\v 17 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but \add be thou\add* in the fear of
the LORD all the day long. 
\v 18 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
\v 19 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. 
\v 20 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh: 
\v 21 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness
shall clothe \add a man\add* with rags. 
\v 22 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when
she is old. 
\v 23 Buy the truth, and sell \add it\add* not; \add also\add* wisdom, and
instruction, and understanding. 
\v 24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth
a wise \add child\add* shall have joy of him. 
\v 25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall
rejoice. 
\v 26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. 
\v 27 For a whore \add is\add* a deep ditch; and a strange woman \add is
\add* a narrow pit. 
\v 28 She also lieth in wait as \add for\add* a prey, and increaseth the
transgressors among men. 
\v 29 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling?
who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes? 
\v 30 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine. 
\v 31 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in
the cup, \add when\add* it moveth itself aright. 
\v 32 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder. 
\v 33 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter
perverse things. 
\v 34 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as
he that lieth upon the top of a mast. 
\v 35 They have stricken me, \add shalt thou say, and\add* I was not sick;
they have beaten me, \add and\add* I felt \add it\add* not: when shall I
awake? I will seek it yet again.
\c 24
\p
\v 1 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them. 
\v 2 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief. 
\v 3 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is
established: 
\v 4 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and
pleasant riches. 
\v 5 A wise man \add is\add* strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth
strength. 
\v 6 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude of
counsellors \add there is\add* safety. 
\v 7 Wisdom \add is\add* too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the
gate. 
\v 8 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person. 
\v 9 The thought of foolishness \add is\add* sin: and the scorner \add is
\add* an abomination to men. 
\v 10 \add If\add* thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength 
\add is\add* small. 
\v 11 If thou forbear to deliver \add them that are\add* drawn unto death, and
\add those that are\add* ready to be slain; 
\v 12 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that pondereth the
heart consider \add it?\add* and he that keepeth thy soul, doth \add not
\add* he know \add it?\add* and shall \add not\add* he render to \add every
\add* man according to his works? 
\v 13 My son, eat thou honey, because \add it is\add* good; and the honeycomb,
\add which is\add* sweet to thy taste: 
\v 14 So \add shall\add* the knowledge of wisdom \add be\add* unto thy soul:
when thou hast found \add it,\add* then there shall be a reward, and thy
expectation shall not be cut off. 
\v 15 Lay not wait, O wicked \add man,\add* against the dwelling of the
righteous; spoil not his resting place: 
\v 16 For a just \add man\add* falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but
the wicked shall fall into mischief. 
\v 17 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart be glad
when he stumbleth: 
\v 18 Lest the LORD see \add it,\add* and it displease him, and he turn away
his wrath from him. 
\v 19 Fret not thyself because of evil \add men,\add* neither be thou envious
at the wicked; 
\v 20 For there shall be no reward to the evil \add man;\add* the candle of
the wicked shall be put out. 
\v 21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: \add and\add* meddle not with
them that are given to change: 
\v 22 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them
both? 
\v 23 These \add things\add* also \add belong\add* to the wise. \add It is
\add* not good to have respect of persons in judgment. 
\v 24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou \add art\add* righteous; him shall
the people curse, nations shall abhor him: 
\v 25 But to them that rebuke \add him\add* shall be delight, and a good
blessing shall come upon them. 
\v 26 \add Every man\add* shall kiss \add his\add* lips that giveth a right
answer. 
\v 27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and
afterwards build thine house. 
\v 28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive 
\add not\add* with thy lips. 
\v 29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the
man according to his work. 
\v 30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void
of understanding; 
\v 31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, \add and\add* nettles had
covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. 
\v 32 Then I saw, \add and\add* considered \add it\add* well: I looked upon 
\add it, and\add* received instruction. 
\v 33 \add Yet\add* a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
hands to sleep: 
\v 34 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an
armed man.
\c 25
\p
\v 1 These \add are\add* also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
king of Judah copied out. 
\v 2 \add It is\add* the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of
kings \add is\add* to search out a matter. 
\v 3 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings 
\add is\add* unsearchable. 
\v 4 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel
for the finer. 
\v 5 Take away the wicked \add from\add* before the king, and his throne shall
be established in righteousness. 
\v 6 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the
place of great \add men: \add*
\v 7 For better \add it is\add* that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine
eyes have seen. 
\v 8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest \add thou know not\add* what to do
in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame. 
\v 9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour \add himself;\add* and discover not a
secret to another: 
\v 10 Lest he that heareth \add it\add* put thee to shame, and thine infamy
turn not away. 
\v 11 A word fitly spoken \add is like\add* apples of gold in pictures of
silver. 
\v 12 \add As\add* an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, 
\add so is\add* a wise reprover upon an obedient ear. 
\v 13 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, \add so is\add* a faithful
messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters. 
\v 14 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift \add is like\add* clouds and wind
without rain. 
\v 15 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the
bone. 
\v 16 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou
be filled therewith, and vomit it. 
\v 17 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house; lest he be weary of thee,
and \add so\add* hate thee. 
\v 18 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour \add is
\add* a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow. 
\v 19 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble \add is like
\add* a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint. 
\v 20 \add As\add* he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, \add and as
\add* vinegar upon nitre, so \add is\add* he that singeth songs to an heavy
heart. 
\v 21 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty,
give him water to drink: 
\v 22 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall
reward thee. 
\v 23 The north wind driveth away rain: so \add doth\add* an angry countenance
a backbiting tongue. 
\v 24 \add It is\add* better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with
a brawling woman and in a wide house. 
\v 25 \add As\add* cold waters to a thirsty soul, so \add is\add* good news
from a far country. 
\v 26 A righteous man falling down before the wicked \add is as\add* a
troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring. 
\v 27 \add It is \add*not good to eat much honey: so \add for men \add*to
search their own glory \add is not \add*glory. 
\v 28 He that \add hath\add* no rule over his own spirit \add is like
\add* a city \add that is\add* broken down, \add and\add* without walls.

\v 1 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a
fool. 
\v 2 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse
causeless shall not come. 
\v 3 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool’s
back. 
\v 4 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto
him. 
\v 5 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own
conceit. 
\v 6 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, 
\add and\add* drinketh damage. 
\v 7 The legs of the lame are not equal: so \add is\add* a parable in the
mouth of fools. 
\v 8 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so \add is\add* he that giveth
honour to a fool. 
\v 9 \add As\add* a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so \add is
\add* a parable in the mouth of fools. 
\v 10 The great \add God\add* that formed all \add things\add* both rewardeth
the fool, and rewardeth transgressors. 
\v 11 As a dog returneth to his vomit, \add so\add* a fool returneth to his
folly. 
\v 12 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? \add there is\add* more hope
of a fool than of him. 
\v 13 The slothful \add man\add* saith, \add There is\add* a lion in the way;
a lion \add is\add* in the streets. 
\v 14 \add As\add* the door turneth upon his hinges, so \add doth\add* the
slothful upon his bed. 
\v 15 The slothful hideth his hand in \add his\add* bosom; it grieveth him to
bring it again to his mouth. 
\v 16 The sluggard \add is\add* wiser in his own conceit than seven men that
can render a reason. 
\v 17 He that passeth by, \add and\add* meddleth with strife \add belonging
\add* not to him, \add is like\add* one that taketh a dog by the ears. 
\v 18 As a mad \add man\add* who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death, 
\v 19 So \add is\add* the man \add that\add* deceiveth his neighbour, and
saith, Am not I in sport? 
\v 20 Where no wood is, \add there\add* the fire goeth out: so where 
\add there is\add* no talebearer, the strife ceaseth. 
\v 21 \add As\add* coals \add are\add* to burning coals, and wood to fire; so
\add is\add* a contentious man to kindle strife. 
\v 22 The words of a talebearer \add are\add* as wounds, and they go down into
the innermost parts of the belly. 
\v 23 Burning lips and a wicked heart \add are like\add* a potsherd covered
with silver dross. 
\v 24 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within
him; 
\v 25 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for \add there are\add* seven
abominations in his heart. 
\v 26 \add Whose\add* hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
shewed before the \add whole\add* congregation. 
\v 27 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it
will return upon him. 
\v 28 A lying tongue hateth \add those that are\add* afflicted by it; and a
flattering mouth worketh ruin.
\c 27
\p
\v 1 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring
forth. 
\v 2 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not
thine own lips. 
\v 3 A stone \add is\add* heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s wrath 
\add is\add* heavier than them both. 
\v 4 Wrath \add is\add* cruel, and anger \add is\add* outrageous; but who 
\add is\add* able to stand before envy? 
\v 5 Open rebuke \add is\add* better than secret love. 
\v 6 Faithful \add are\add* the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy
\add are\add* deceitful. 
\v 7 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter
thing is sweet. 
\v 8 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so \add is\add* a man that
wandereth from his place. 
\v 9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so \add doth\add* the sweetness
of a man’s friend by hearty counsel. 
\v 10 Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; neither go into
thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: \add for\add* better 
\add is\add* a neighbour \add that is\add* near than a brother far off. 
\v 11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that
reproacheth me. 
\v 12 A prudent \add man\add* foreseeth the evil, \add and\add* hideth
himself; \add but\add* the simple pass on, \add and\add* are punished. 
\v 13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him
for a strange woman. 
\v 14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the
morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. 
\v 15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are
alike. 
\v 16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right
hand, \add which\add* bewrayeth \add itself. \add*
\v 17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his
friend. 
\v 18 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that
waiteth on his master shall be honoured. 
\v 19 As in water face \add answereth\add* to face, so the heart of man to
man. 
\v 20 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never
satisfied. 
\v 21 \add As\add* the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so 
\add is\add* a man to his praise. 
\v 22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle,
\add yet\add* will not his foolishness depart from him. 
\v 23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, \add and\add* look
well to thy herds. 
\v 24 For riches \add are\add* not for ever: and doth the crown \add endure
\add* to every generation? 
\v 25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the
mountains are gathered. 
\v 26 The lambs \add are\add* for thy clothing, and the goats \add are
\add* the price of the field. 
\v 27 And \add thou shalt have\add* goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the
food of thy household, and \add for\add* the maintenance for thy maidens.

\v 1 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a
lion. 
\v 2 For the transgression of a land many \add are\add* the princes thereof:
but by a man of understanding \add and\add* knowledge the state \add thereof
\add* shall be prolonged. 
\v 3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor \add is like\add* a sweeping rain
which leaveth no food. 
\v 4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law
contend with them. 
\v 5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand
all \add things. \add*
\v 6 Better \add is\add* the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than 
\add he that is\add* perverse \add in his\add* ways, though he \add be
\add* rich. 
\v 7 Whoso keepeth the law \add is\add* a wise son: but he that is a companion
of riotous \add men\add* shameth his father. 
\v 8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall
gather it for him that will pity the poor. 
\v 9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer 
\add shall be\add* abomination. 
\v 10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall
himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good \add things
\add* in possession. 
\v 11 The rich man \add is\add* wise in his own conceit; but the poor that
hath understanding searcheth him out. 
\v 12 When righteous \add men\add* do rejoice, \add there is\add* great glory:
but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden. 
\v 13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and
forsaketh \add them\add* shall have mercy. 
\v 14 Happy \add is\add* the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his
heart shall fall into mischief. 
\v 15 \add As\add* a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; \add so is\add* a
wicked ruler over the poor people. 
\v 16 The prince that wanteth understanding \add is\add* also a great
oppressor: \add but\add* he that hateth covetousness shall prolong \add his
\add* days. 
\v 17 A man that doeth violence to the blood of \add any\add* person shall
flee to the pit; let no man stay him. 
\v 18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but \add he that is\add*
perverse \add in his\add* ways shall fall at once. 
\v 19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that
followeth after vain \add persons\add* shall have poverty enough. 
\v 20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to
be rich shall not be innocent. 
\v 21 To have respect of persons \add is\add* not good: for for a piece of
bread \add that\add* man will transgress. 
\v 22 He that hasteth to be rich \add hath\add* an evil eye, and considereth
not that poverty shall come upon him. 
\v 23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that
flattereth with the tongue. 
\v 24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, \add It is
\add* no transgression; the same \add is\add* the companion of a destroyer. 
\v 25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his
trust in the LORD shall be made fat. 
\v 26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely,
he shall be delivered. 
\v 27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes
shall have many a curse. 
\v 28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the
righteous increase.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 He, that being often reproved hardeneth \add his\add* neck, shall
suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. 
\v 2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the
wicked beareth rule, the people mourn. 
\v 3 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company
with harlots spendeth \add his\add* substance. 
\v 4 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts
overthroweth it. 
\v 5 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. 
\v 6 In the transgression of an evil man \add there is\add* a snare: but the
righteous doth sing and rejoice. 
\v 7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: \add but\add* the wicked
regardeth not to know \add it. \add*
\v 8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise \add men\add* turn away
wrath. 
\v 9 \add If\add* a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or
laugh, \add there is\add* no rest. 
\v 10 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul. 
\v 11 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise \add man\add* keepeth it in
till afterwards. 
\v 12 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants \add are\add* wicked. 
\v 13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both
their eyes. 
\v 14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be
established for ever. 
\v 15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left \add to himself
\add* bringeth his mother to shame. 
\v 16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the
righteous shall see their fall. 
\v 17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight
unto thy soul. 
\v 18 Where \add there is\add* no vision, the people perish: but he that
keepeth the law, happy \add is\add* he. 
\v 19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he
will not answer. 
\v 20 Seest thou a man \add that is\add* hasty in his words? \add there is
\add* more hope of a fool than of him. 
\v 21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him
become \add his\add* son at the length. 
\v 22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in
transgression. 
\v 23 A man’s pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in
spirit. 
\v 24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing,
and bewrayeth \add it\add* not. 
\v 25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the
LORD shall be safe. 
\v 26 Many seek the ruler’s favour; but \add every\add* man’s judgment 
\add cometh\add* from the LORD. 
\v 27 An unjust man \add is\add* an abomination to the just: and \add he that
is\add* upright in the way \add is\add* abomination to the wicked.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, \add even\add* the prophecy: the man
spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal, 
\v 2 Surely I \add am\add* more brutish than \add any\add* man, and have not
the understanding of a man. 
\v 3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy. 
\v 4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the
wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath
established all the ends of the earth? what \add is\add* his name, and what 
\add is\add* his son’s name, if thou canst tell? 
\v 5 Every word of God \add is\add* pure: he \add is\add* a shield unto them
that put their trust in him. 
\v 6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a
liar. 
\v 7 Two \add things\add* have I required of thee; deny me \add them
\add* not before I die: 
\v 8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches;
feed me with food convenient for me: 
\v 9 Lest I be full, and deny \add thee,\add* and say, Who \add is\add* the
LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God \add in vain.
\add*
\v 10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be
found guilty. 
\v 11 \add There is\add* a generation \add that\add* curseth their father, and
doth not bless their mother. 
\v 12 \add There is\add* a generation \add that are\add* pure in their own
eyes, and \add yet\add* is not washed from their filthiness. 
\v 13 \add There is\add* a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their
eyelids are lifted up. 
\v 14 \add There is\add* a generation, whose teeth \add are as\add* swords,
and their jaw teeth \add as\add* knives, to devour the poor from off the
earth, and the needy from \add among\add* men. 
\v 15 The horseleach hath two daughters, \add crying,\add* Give, give. There
are three \add things that are\add* never satisfied, \add yea,\add* four 
\add things\add* say not, \add It is\add* enough: 
\v 16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth \add that\add* is not filled
with water; and the fire \add that\add* saith not, \add It is\add* enough. 
\v 17 The eye \add that\add* mocketh at \add his\add* father, and despiseth to
obey \add his\add* mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the
young eagles shall eat it. 
\v 18 There be three \add things which\add* are too wonderful for me, yea,
four which I know not: 
\v 19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the
way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. 
\v 20 Such \add is\add* the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth
her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. 
\v 21 For three \add things\add* the earth is disquieted, and for four 
\add which\add* it cannot bear: 
\v 22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
\v 23 For an odious \add woman\add* when she is married; and an handmaid that
is heir to her mistress. 
\v 24 There be four \add things which are\add* little upon the earth, but they
\add are\add* exceeding wise: 
\v 25 The ants \add are\add* a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat
in the summer; 
\v 26 The conies \add are but\add* a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
in the rocks; 
\v 27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; 
\v 28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces. 
\v 29 There be three \add things\add* which go well, yea, four are comely in
going: 
\v 30 A lion \add which is\add* strongest among beasts, and turneth not away
for any; 
\v 31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom \add there is
\add* no rising up. 
\v 32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast
thought evil, \add lay\add* thine hand upon thy mouth. 
\v 33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of
the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
\c 31
\p
\v 1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him. 
\v 2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my
vows? 
\v 3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth
kings. 
\v 4 \add It is\add* not for kings, O Lemuel, \add it is\add* not for kings to
drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: 
\v 5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of
the afflicted. 
\v 6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those
that be of heavy hearts. 
\v 7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 
\v 8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to
destruction. 
\v 9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and
needy.
\p
\v 10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price \add is\add* far above
rubies. 
\v 11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have
no need of spoil. 
\v 12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. 
\v 13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. 
\v 14 She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from afar. 
\v 15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household,
and a portion to her maidens. 
\v 16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she
planteth a vineyard. 
\v 17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 
\v 18 She perceiveth that her merchandise \add is\add* good: her candle goeth
not out by night. 
\v 19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff. 
\v 20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her
hands to the needy. 
\v 21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household 
\add are\add* clothed with scarlet. 
\v 22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing \add is
\add* silk and purple. 
\v 23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of
the land. 
\v 24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth \add it;\add* and delivereth girdles
unto the merchant. 
\v 25 Strength and honour \add are\add* her clothing; and she shall rejoice in
time to come. 
\v 26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue \add is\add* the
law of kindness. 
\v 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread
of idleness. 
\v 28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband \add also,
\add* and he praiseth her. 
\v 29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all. 
\v 30 Favour \add is\add* deceitful, and beauty \add is\add* vain: \add but
\add* a woman \add that\add* feareth the LORD, she shall be praised. 
\v 31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in
the gates.
