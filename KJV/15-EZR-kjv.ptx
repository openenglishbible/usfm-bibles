\p
\v 1 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD
by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of
Cyrus king of Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom,
and \add put it\add* also in writing, saying, 
\v 2 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath given me all
the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me to build him an house at
Jerusalem, which \add is\add* in Judah. 
\v 3 Who \add is there\add* among you of all his people? his God be with him,
and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the
LORD God of Israel, (he \add is\add* the God,) which \add is\add* in
Jerusalem. 
\v 4 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of
his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with
beasts, beside the freewill offering for the house of God that \add is
\add* in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the
priests, and the Levites, with all \add them\add* whose spirit God had raised,
to go up to build the house of the LORD which \add is\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 6 And all they that \add were\add* about them strengthened their hands with
vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious
things, beside all \add that\add* was willingly offered.
\p
\v 7 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the LORD,
which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put them in
the house of his gods; 
\v 8 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath
the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah. 
\v 9 And this \add is\add* the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a
thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives, 
\v 10 Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second \add sort\add* four
hundred and ten, \add and\add* other vessels a thousand. 
\v 11 All the vessels of gold and of silver \add were\add* five thousand and
four hundred. All \add these\add* did Sheshbazzar bring up with \add them of
\add* the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now these \add are\add* the children of the province that went up out of
the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the
king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem
and Judah, every one unto his city;

\p
\v 43 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the

\v 44 The children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of Padon, 
\v 45 The children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children of

\p
\v 55 The children of Solomon’s servants: the children of Sotai, the children

\v 56 The children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,
\v 57 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of
Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami. 
\v 58 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon’s servants, \add were
\add* three hundred ninety and two. 
\v 59 And these \add were\add* they which went up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsa,
Cherub, Addan, \add and\add* Immer: but they could not shew their father’s
house, and their seed, whether they \add were\add* of Israel: 
\v 60 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda,
six hundred fifty and two.
\p
\v 61 And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the
children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a wife of the daughters
of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name: 
\v 62 These sought their register \add among\add* those that were reckoned by
genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from
the priesthood. 
\v 63 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most
holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.
\p
\v 64 The whole congregation together \add was\add* forty and two thousand
three hundred \add and\add* threescore, 
\v 65 Beside their servants and their maids, of whom \add there were
\add* seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and \add there were
\add* among them two hundred singing men and singing women. 
\v 66 Their horses \add were\add* seven hundred thirty and six; their mules,
two hundred forty and five; 
\v 67 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; \add their\add* asses, six
thousand seven hundred and twenty.
\p
\v 68 And \add some\add* of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the
house of the LORD which \add is\add* at Jerusalem, offered freely for the
house of God to set it up in his place: 
\v 69 They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore
and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of silver, and one
hundred priests garments. 
\v 70 So the priests, and the Levites, and \add some\add* of the people, and
the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and
all Israel in their cities.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 And when the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel 
\add were\add* in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one
man to Jerusalem. 
\v 2 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests,
and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and builded the altar
of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as \add it is
\add* written in the law of Moses the man of God. 
\v 3 And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear \add was\add* upon them
because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings
thereon unto the LORD, \add even\add* burnt offerings morning and evening. 
\v 4 They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as \add it is\add* written, and
\add offered\add* the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the
custom, as the duty of every day required; 
\v 5 And afterward \add offered\add* the continual burnt offering, both of the
new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of
every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the LORD. 
\v 6 From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt
offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not
\add yet\add* laid. 
\v 7 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters; and meat,
and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them of Tyre, to bring cedar
trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the grant that they had
of Cyrus king of Persia.
\p
\v 8 Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God at
Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and
Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren the priests and
the Levites, and all they that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem;
and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward
the work of the house of the LORD. 
\v 9 Then stood Jeshua \add with\add* his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and
his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house
of God: the sons of Henadad, \add with\add* their sons and their brethren the
Levites. 
\v 10 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD,
they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and the Levites the sons
of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the LORD, after the ordinance of David king
of Israel. 
\v 11 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the
LORD; because \add he is\add* good, for his mercy \add endureth\add* for ever
toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they
praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid. 
\v 12 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers, 
\add who were\add* ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the
foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice;
and many shouted aloud for joy: 
\v 13 So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from
the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud
shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the children of
the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God of Israel; 
\v 2 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers, and said
unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your God, as ye \add do;
\add* and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esar- haddon king of
Assur, which brought us up hither. 
\v 3 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of
Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto
our God; but we ourselves together will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as
king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. 
\v 4 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah,
and troubled them in building, 
\v 5 And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the
days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia. 
\v 6 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, wrote they
\add unto him\add* an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and
Jerusalem.
\p
\v 7 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the
rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king of Persia; and the writing of
the letter \add was\add* written in the Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the
Syrian tongue. 
\v 8 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against
Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort: 
\v 9 Then \add wrote\add* Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and
the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the
Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites,
the Dehavites, \add and\add* the Elamites, 
\v 10 And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper brought
over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest \add that are\add* on
this side the river, and at such a time.
\p
\v 11 This \add is\add* the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, 
\add even\add* unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side the
river, and at such a time. 
\v 12 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us
are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have
set up the walls \add thereof,\add* and joined the foundations. 
\v 13 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded, and the
walls set up \add again, then\add* will they not pay toll, tribute, and
custom, and \add so\add* thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings. 
\v 14 Now because we have maintenance from \add the king’s\add* palace, and it
was not meet for us to see the king’s dishonour, therefore have we sent and
certified the king; 
\v 15 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: so
shalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city 
\add is\add* a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, and that
they have moved sedition within the same of old time: for which cause was this
city destroyed. 
\v 16 We certify the king that, if this city be builded \add again,
\add* and the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no portion
on this side the river.
\p
\v 17 \add Then\add* sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and 
\add to\add* Shimshai the scribe, and \add to\add* the rest of their
companions that dwell in Samaria, and \add unto\add* the rest beyond the
river, Peace, and at such a time. 
\v 18 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me. 
\v 19 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found that this
city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and \add that
\add* rebellion and sedition have been made therein. 
\v 20 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over
all \add countries\add* beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was
paid unto them. 
\v 21 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that this city
be not builded, until \add another\add* commandment shall be given from me. 
\v 22 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to the
hurt of the kings?
\p
\v 23 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes’ letter \add was\add* read before
Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to
Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to cease by force and power. 
\v 24 Then ceased the work of the house of God which \add is\add* at
Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius king of
Persia.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo,
prophesied unto the Jews that \add were\add* in Judah and Jerusalem in the
name of the God of Israel, \add even\add* unto them. 
\v 2 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of
Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which \add is\add* at Jerusalem:
and with them \add were\add* the prophets of God helping them.
\p
\v 3 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side the river,
and Shethar- boznai, and their companions, and said thus unto them, Who hath
commanded you to build this house, and to make up this wall? 
\v 4 Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names of the men
that make this building? 
\v 5 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that they could
not cause them to cease, till the matter came to Darius: and then they
returned answer by letter concerning this \add matter.\add*
\p
\v 6 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the river, and
Shethar- boznai, and his companions the Apharsachites, which \add were
\add* on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king: 
\v 7 They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto Darius the
king, all peace. 
\v 8 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of Judea, to
the house of the great God, which is builded with great stones, and timber is
laid in the walls, and this work goeth fast on, and prospereth in their
hands. 
\v 9 Then asked we those elders, \add and\add* said unto them thus, Who
commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls? 
\v 10 We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might write the
names of the men that \add were\add* the chief of them. 
\v 11 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants of the God
of heaven and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years
ago, which a great king of Israel builded and set up. 
\v 12 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto wrath, he
gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, the Chaldean,
who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon. 
\v 13 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon \add the same
\add* king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God. 
\v 14 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which
Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that \add was\add* in Jerusalem, and
brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus the king take out of
the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto \add one,\add* whose name
\add was\add* Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor; 
\v 15 And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple
that \add is\add* in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be builded in his
place. 
\v 16 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, \add and\add* laid the foundation of the
house of God which \add is\add* in Jerusalem: and since that time even until
now hath it been in building, and \add yet\add* it is not finished. 
\v 17 Now therefore, if \add it seem\add* good to the king, let there be
search made in the king’s treasure house, which \add is\add* there at Babylon,
whether it be \add so,\add* that a decree was made of Cyrus the king to build
this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send his pleasure to us
concerning this matter.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of
the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon. 
\v 2 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the province of
the Medes, a roll, and therein \add was\add* a record thus written: 
\v 3 In the first year of Cyrus the king \add the same\add* Cyrus the king
made a decree \add concerning\add* the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the
house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the
foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, 
\add and\add* the breadth thereof threescore cubits; 
\v 4 \add With\add* three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and
let the expences be given out of the king’s house: 
\v 5 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which
Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at Jerusalem, and brought
unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which is at
Jerusalem, \add every one\add* to his place, and place \add them\add* in the
house of God. 
\v 6 Now \add therefore,\add* Tatnai, governor beyond the river,
Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which \add are
\add* beyond the river, be ye far from thence: 
\v 7 Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and
the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place. 
\v 8 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for
the building of this house of God: that of the king’s goods, \add even
\add* of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expences be given unto these
men, that they be not hindered. 
\v 9 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and
lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and
oil, according to the appointment of the priests which \add are\add* at
Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: 
\v 10 That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven,
and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons. 
\v 11 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let
timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged
thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this. 
\v 12 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings
and people, that shall put to their hand to alter \add and\add* to destroy
this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it
be done with speed.
\p
\v 13 Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their
companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did
speedily. 
\v 14 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the
prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they
builded, and finished \add it,\add* according to the commandment of the God of
Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes
king of Persia. 
\v 15 And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which
was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king.
\p
\v 16 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest
of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God
with joy, 
\v 17 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred bullocks,
two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel,
twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. 
\v 18 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their
courses, for the service of God, which \add is\add* at Jerusalem; as it is
written in the book of Moses. 
\v 19 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth
\add day\add* of the first month. 
\v 20 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them 
\add were\add* pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the
captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. 
\v 21 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and
all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the
heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat, 
\v 22 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD
had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them,
to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra
the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
\v 2 The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
\v 3 The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
\v 4 The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
\v 5 The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of
Aaron the chief priest: 
\v 6 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he \add was\add* a ready scribe in
the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and the king granted
him all his request, according to the hand of the LORD his God upon him. 
\v 7 And there went up \add some\add* of the children of Israel, and of the
priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims,
unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king. 
\v 8 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which \add was\add* in the
seventh year of the king. 
\v 9 For upon the first \add day\add* of the first month began he to go up
from Babylon, and on the first \add day\add* of the fifth month came he to
Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him. 
\v 10 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD, and to do 
\add it,\add* and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.
\p
\v 11 Now this \add is\add* the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes
gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, \add even\add* a scribe of the words of
the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to Israel. 
\v 12 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of the law of
the God of heaven, perfect \add peace,\add* and at such a time. 
\v 13 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and \add of
\add* his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of their own
freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee. 
\v 14 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven counsellors, to
enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which
\add is\add* in thine hand; 
\v 15 And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors
have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose habitation \add is
\add* in Jerusalem, 
\v 16 And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of
Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people, and of the priests,
offering willingly for the house of their God which \add is\add* in
Jerusalem: 
\v 17 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams, lambs,
with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the
altar of the house of your God which \add is\add* in Jerusalem. 
\v 18 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren, to do with
the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God. 
\v 19 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy
God, \add those\add* deliver thou before the God of Jerusalem. 
\v 20 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God, which
thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow \add it\add* out of the king’s
treasure house. 
\v 21 And I, \add even\add* I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
treasurers which \add are\add* beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra the
priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it
be done speedily, 
\v 22 Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures of wheat,
and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred baths of oil, and salt
without prescribing \add how much. \add*
\v 23 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be diligently done
for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the
realm of the king and his sons? 
\v 24 Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and Levites,
singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this house of God, it shall not
be lawful to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them. 
\v 25 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that \add is\add* in thine
hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the people that 
\add are\add* beyond the river, all such as know the laws of thy God; and
teach ye them that know \add them\add* not. 
\v 26 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of the king,
let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether \add it be\add* unto
death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of goods, or to imprisonment.
\p
\v 27 Blessed \add be\add* the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put 
\add such a thing\add* as this in the king’s heart, to beautify the house of
the LORD which \add is\add* in Jerusalem: 
\v 28 And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors,
and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I was strengthened as the hand
of the LORD my God \add was\add* upon me, and I gathered together out of
Israel chief men to go up with me.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 These \add are\add* now the chief of their fathers, and \add this is
\add* the genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of
Artaxerxes the king. 
\v 2 Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the
sons of David; Hattush. 
\v 3 Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with
him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and fifty. 
\v 4 Of the sons of Pahath- moab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and with him
two hundred males. 
\v 5 Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three
hundred males. 
\v 6 Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty
males. 
\v 7 And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with him
seventy males. 
\v 8 And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and with him
fourscore males. 
\v 9 Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred
and eighteen males. 
\v 10 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him an
hundred and threescore males. 
\v 11 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with him
twenty and eight males. 
\v 12 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with him an
hundred and ten males. 
\v 13 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names \add are\add* these,
Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males. 
\v 14 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them seventy
males.
\p
\v 15 And I gathered them together to the river than runneth to Ahava; and
there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the priests,
and found there none of the sons of Levi. 
\v 16 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for Elnathan, and
for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for Zechariah, and for
Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for Elnathan, men of
understanding. 
\v 17 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the place
Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, \add and\add* to his
brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should bring unto us
ministers for the house of our God. 
\v 18 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of
understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and
Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen; 
\v 19 And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren
and their sons, twenty; 
\v 20 Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the
service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were
expressed by name.
\p
\v 21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we might
afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us, and for
our little ones, and for all our substance. 
\v 22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen
to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken unto the king,
saying, The hand of our God \add is\add* upon all them for good that seek him;
but his power and his wrath \add is\add* against all them that forsake him. 
\v 23 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated of us.
\p
\v 24 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,
Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them, 
\v 25 And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, 
\add even\add* the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his
counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel \add there\add* present, had
offered: 
\v 26 I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver,
and silver vessels an hundred talents, \add and\add* of gold an hundred
talents; 
\v 27 Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels of fine
copper, precious as gold. 
\v 28 And I said unto them, Ye \add are\add* holy unto the LORD; the vessels 
\add are\add* holy also; and the silver and the gold \add are\add* a freewill
offering unto the LORD God of your fathers. 
\v 29 Watch ye, and keep \add them,\add* until ye weigh \add them\add* before
the chief of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel,
at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD. 
\v 30 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver, and the
gold, and the vessels, to bring \add them\add* to Jerusalem unto the house of
our God.
\p
\v 31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth \add day
\add* of the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was
upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in
wait by the way. 
\v 32 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.
\p
\v 33 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels
weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Uriah the
priest; and with him \add was\add* Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and with them
\add was\add* Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui,
Levites; 
\v 34 By number \add and\add* by weight of every one: and all the weight was
written at that time. 
\v 35 \add Also\add* the children of those that had been carried away, which
were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of
Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and seven
lambs, twelve he goats \add for\add* a sin offering: all \add this was
\add* a burnt offering unto the LORD.
\p
\v 36 And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s lieutenants,
and to the governors on this side the river: and they furthered the people,
and the house of God.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The
people of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites, have not separated
themselves from the people of the lands, \add doing\add* according to their
abominations, \add even\add* of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites,
the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites. 
\v 2 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for their
sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of 
\add those\add* lands: yea, the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief
in this trespass. 
\v 3 And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle, and plucked
off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat down astonied. 
\v 4 Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the
God of Israel, because of the transgression of those that had been carried
away; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.
\p
\v 5 And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and having
rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees, and spread out my hands
unto the LORD my God. 
\v 6 And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee, my
God: for our iniquities are increased over \add our\add* head, and our
trespass is grown up unto the heavens. 
\v 7 Since the days of our fathers \add have\add* we \add been\add* in a great
trespass unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and 
\add our\add* priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands,
to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to confusion of face, as 
\add it is\add* this day. 
\v 8 And now for a little space grace hath been \add shewed\add* from the LORD
our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us a nail in his holy
place, that our God may lighten our eyes, and give us a little reviving in our
bondage. 
\v 9 For we \add were\add* bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of Persia,
to give us a reviving, to set up the house of our God, and to repair the
desolations thereof, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem. 
\v 10 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have forsaken
thy commandments, 
\v 11 Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets, saying, The
land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land with the filthiness
of the people of the lands, with their abominations, which have filled it from
one end to another with their uncleanness. 
\v 12 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither take
their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever:
that ye may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave \add it
\add* for an inheritance to your children for ever. 
\v 13 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great
trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us less than our iniquities 
\add deserve,\add* and hast given us \add such\add* deliverance as this; 
\v 14 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity with the
people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou
hadst consumed \add us,\add* so that \add there should be\add* no remnant nor
escaping? 
\v 15 O LORD God of Israel, thou \add art\add* righteous: for we remain yet
escaped, as \add it is\add* this day: behold, we \add are\add* before thee in
our trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping and casting
himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a
very great congregation of men and women and children: for the people wept
very sore. 
\v 2 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, \add one\add* of the sons of Elam,
answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our God, and have
taken strange wives of the people of the land: yet now there is hope in Israel
concerning this thing. 
\v 3 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the
wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and
of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done
according to the law. 
\v 4 Arise; for \add this\add* matter \add belongeth\add* unto thee: we also 
\add will be\add* with thee: be of good courage, and do \add it. \add*
\v 5 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all Israel,
to swear that they should do according to this word. And they sware.
\p
\v 6 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into the chamber
of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and \add when\add* he came thither, he did eat
no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned because of the transgression of them
that had been carried away. 
\v 7 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the
children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto
Jerusalem; 
\v 8 And that whosoever would not come within three days, according to the
counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited,
and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried
away.
\p
\v 9 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto
Jerusalem within three days. It \add was\add* the ninth month, on the
twentieth \add day\add* of the month; and all the people sat in the street of
the house of God, trembling because of \add this\add* matter, and for the
great rain. 
\v 10 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed,
and have taken strange wives, to increase the trespass of Israel. 
\v 11 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your fathers, and do
his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the people of the land, and from
the strange wives. 
\v 12 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, As thou
hast said, so must we do. 
\v 13 But the people \add are\add* many, and \add it is\add* a time of much
rain, and we are not able to stand without, neither \add is this\add* a work
of one day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this thing. 
\v 14 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all them which
have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times, and with them
the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of
our God for this matter be turned from us.
\p
\v 15 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah were
employed about this \add matter:\add* and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite
helped them. 
\v 16 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest, 
\add with\add* certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their fathers,
and all of them by \add their\add* names, were separated, and sat down in the
first day of the tenth month to examine the matter. 
\v 17 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by
the first day of the first month.
\p
\v 18 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken
strange wives: \add namely,\add* of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and
his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
\v 19 And they gave their hands that they would put away their wives; and 
\add being\add* guilty, \add they offered\add* a ram of the flock for their
trespass. 
\v 20 And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah. 
\v 21 And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah, and
Jehiel, and Uzziah. 
\v 22 And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel,
Jozabad, and Elasah. 
\v 23 Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the same 
\add is\add* Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer. 
\v 24 Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum, and Telem,
and Uri. 
\v 25 Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah, and
Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and Benaiah. 
\v 26 And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and Abdi, and
Jeremoth, and Eliah. 
\v 27 And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and Jeremoth,
and Zabad, and Aziza. 
\v 28 Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, \add and
\add* Athlai. 
\v 29 And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah, Jashub, and
Sheal, and Ramoth. 
\v 30 And of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah,
Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh. 
\v 31 And \add of\add* the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah,
Shemaiah, Shimeon, 
\v 32 Benjamin, Malluch, \add and\add* Shemariah. 
\v 33 Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai,
Manasseh, \add and\add* Shimei. 
\v 34 Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel, 
\v 35 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh, 
\v 36 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
\v 37 Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau, 
\v 38 And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei, 
\v 39 And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah, 
\v 40 Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 
\v 41 Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
\v 42 Shallum, Amariah, \add and\add* Joseph. 
\v 43 Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, and Joel,
Benaiah. 
\v 44 All these had taken strange wives: and \add some\add* of them had wives
by whom they had children.
